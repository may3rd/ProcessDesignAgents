    <problem_statement>Design a new unit for the production of 50,000 metric tons per annum (MTA) of Grade A Biodiesel (FAME). The feed is unrefined palm oil (FFA content 4.5 wt%). The process must be continuous. The plant will be located in a region with high humidity and is constrained to a maximum potable water consumption of 100 mÂ³/day. The final product must meet EN 14214 standards.</problem_statement>

    <expected_markdown_output>## Preliminary Process Basis of Design (BoD)

### 1. Project Overview and Problem Statement
This document provides the preliminary basis for the design of a new continuous Biodiesel (Fatty Acid Methyl Ester - FAME) production unit. The primary objective is to convert a high Free-Fatty-Acid (FFA) content unrefined palm oil feedstock into 50,000 MTA of Grade A Biodiesel that complies with the EN 14214 standard. The design must accommodate a site location with high humidity and adhere to a strict potable water consumption limit of 100 mÂ³/day.

### 2. Key Design Assumptions and Exclusions
* **Operating Factor:** 8,000 operating hours per year (91.3 percent stream factor) is assumed for continuous operation.
* **Process Technology:** A two-step process involving pre-treatment (esterification) and main reaction (transesterification) is assumed necessary to handle the high FFA feed.
* **Design Margin:** 1.1 design margin is applied to achieve 55,000 MTA design capacity from the 50,000 MTA nameplate requirement.
* **Plant Lifespan:** The facility will be designed for a minimum operational life of 20 years.
* **Location:** Design conditions will assume a tropical/high-humidity environment (ambient temperature up to 40Â°C, RH &amp;gt;90%).
* **Exclusions:** This preliminary BoD excludes detailed mechanical design, civil/structural design, P&amp;IDs, control narratives, and detailed cost estimation.

### 3. Design Capacity and Operating Conditions
| Parameter | Value | Units | Basis |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Nameplate Capacity** | 50,000 | MTA | User Requirement |
| **Design Capacity** | 55,000 | MTA | 10% Design Margin |
| **Hourly Production Rate** | 6,875 | kg/hr | Based on 8,000 operating hours per year |
| **Reaction Type** | Acid Esterification &amp; Base Transesterification | N/A | High FFA Feedstock |
| **Typical Reactor Pressure** | Atmospheric to 5 barg | barg | Preliminary Estimate |
| **Typical Reactor Temp.** | 60 - 150 Â°C | Â°C | Preliminary Estimate |

### 4. Chemical Components
| **Name** | **Formula** | **MW** | **BP** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Methanol | CH3OH | 32.042 | 78.4 |
| Sulfuric Acid | H2SO4 | 98.079 | 100.0 |
| Sodium Hydroxide | NaOH | 40.005 | 100.0 |
| Biodiesel (FAME) | Variable | 290â€“310 | Variable |
| Glycerin | C3H8O3 | 92.094 | 100.0 |
| Water | H2O | 18.015 | 100.0 |

### 5. Feed and Product Specifications

#### Feed Specification (Unrefined Palm Oil)
* **FFA Content (Max):** 4.5 wt%
* **Moisture Content (Max):** 0.5 wt% (Assumed standard)
* **Impurities (Max):** 1.0 wt% (Assumed standard)

#### Product Specification (Grade A Biodiesel - FAME)
* **Target Standard:** EN 14214
* **Methyl Ester Content (Min):** 96.5 wt%
* **Total Glycerol (Max):** 0.25 wt%
* **Water Content (Max):** 500 ppm

### 6. Preliminary Utility Summary
* **Potable Water:** Maximum 100 mÂ³/day (Critical Constraint). Design will prioritize air cooling and process water recycling.
* **Process Water:** De-mineralized (DM) water required for product washing. An on-site reverse osmosis (RO) plant is assumed.
* **Steam:** Low-pressure (LP) steam (~5 barg) required for heating reactors and distillation columns.
* **Cooling Water or Air Cooling:** Air-cooled heat exchangers assumed to minimize potable water demand.
* **Electricity:** 415V / 3-phase / 50Hz standard is assumed.
* **Instrument Air:** Standard plant instrument air supply required.

### 7. Environmental and Regulatory Criteria
* **Air Emissions:** Vent streams containing methanol and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) will be routed to a thermal oxidizer or scrubber system to comply with local air quality regulations.
* **Wastewater:** All process wastewater (e.g., from washing) will be directed to an on-site wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) to meet regulatory discharge limits before being discharged or recycled.
* **Site Constraint:** The design must strictly adhere to the 100 mÂ³/day maximum potable water consumption limit.
* **Solid Waste:** Spent catalyst and salt byproducts will be staged for off-site disposal or recycling per local regulations.

### 8. Process Selection Rationale (High-Level)
The high FFA content of the palm oil feed makes a single-step transesterification process unfeasible due to soap formation and reduced conversion efficiency. Therefore, a two-step approach is selected as a robust, commercially proven pathway. The first step, **Acid-catalyzed Esterification**, will convert FFAs to esters, reducing FFA content to &amp;lt;1%. The second step, **Alkali-catalyzed Transesterification**, will convert the remaining triglycerides to FAME and glycerin.

### 9. Preliminary Material of Construction (MoC) Basis
* **General Service:** Carbon Steel (CS) for non-corrosive services (e.g., crude oil storage, utilities).
* **Reaction/Acid Service:** Stainless Steel (304L or 316L) is required for reactors, distillation columns, and any equipment in contact with the acid catalyst or high-purity product.
* **Alkali Service:** Stainless Steel (304L) acceptable for alkali-catalyzed sections; verify with vendor for caustic soda compatibility.
* **Gaskets/Seals:** Viton or PTFE for all process streams containing methanol or biodiesel.</expected_markdown_output>
