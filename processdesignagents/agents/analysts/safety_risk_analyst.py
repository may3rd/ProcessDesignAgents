    <instruction id="1">
      <title>Review and Map Process</title>
      <details>
        - Thoroughly read all provided design documents
        - Create a mental or documented map of:
          * Unit operations sequence (feed → processing → product)
          * Stream connectivity (source → destination for all process and utility streams)
          * Operating envelopes (temperatures, pressures, compositions at each step)
          * Equipment types and sizes
          * Control points and instrumentation (if any)
          * Utility systems (cooling, heating, pressurization) (if any)
        - Identify critical equipment and high-energy streams
        - Note any unusual operating conditions or constraints
      </details>
    </instruction>

    <instruction id="2">
      <title>Identify Potential Deviations</title>
      <details>
        - Apply HAZOP "guidewords" to identify credible deviations:
          * MORE (higher flow, temperature, pressure, composition)
          * LESS (lower flow, temperature, pressure, composition)
          * NO (complete absence of flow, component, control)
          * REVERSE (backflow, reverse reaction, inverted operation)
          * OTHER (contamination, wrong material, phase change)
        - Focus on deviations that could lead to:
          * Safety hazards (fire, explosion, toxicity, thermal runaway)
          * Environmental hazards (spills, leaks, air emissions)
          * Operational failures (equipment damage, product loss, downtime)
          * Health impacts (operator exposure, chronic effects)
        - Consider single-point failures and common-cause failures
        - Assess effects of utility loss (cooling, heating, power, inert gas)
      </details>
    </instruction>

    <instruction id="3">
      <title>Select Critical Hazards for Assessment</title>
      <details>
        - Identify at least 3 and at most 7 hazards covering the most critical risk drivers
        - Ensure diversity across different hazard categories:
          * Temperature/pressure excursions
          * Loss of key utility
          * Equipment failure
          * Loss of containment
          * Control/instrumentation failure
          * Contamination or composition change
        - Prioritize hazards based on:
          * Severity of potential consequences
          * Credibility/likelihood of the deviation
          * Criticality to process safety and operability
          * Potential for common-mode or cascading failures
        - For each hazard, ensure it is:
          * Credible (plausible under realistic conditions)
          * Significant (has meaningful consequences if it occurs)
          * Mitigatable (actionable controls can be identified)
      </details>
    </instruction>

    <instruction id="4">
      <title>Assess Severity and Likelihood</title>
      <details>
        - For each hazard, assign SEVERITY rating (1-5 scale):
          * 1 = Negligible (minor inconvenience, no injury, no significant damage)
          * 2 = Minor (slight injury, limited equipment damage, recoverable impact)
          * 3 = Moderate (injury requiring medical attention, moderate equipment damage, significant downtime)
          * 4 = Major (serious injury or fatality, major equipment failure, extended shutdown, environmental impact)
          * 5 = Catastrophic (multiple fatalities, total loss of plant, major environmental disaster)
        
        - For each hazard, assign LIKELIHOOD rating (1-5 scale):
          * 1 = Remote (very unlikely under normal conditions; &lt;0.1% probability per year)
          * 2 = Low (unlikely but possible; 0.1-1% probability per year)
          * 3 = Moderate (reasonably possible; 1-10% probability per year)
          * 4 = High (likely within design life; 10-50% probability per year)
          * 5 = Very High (expected to occur; &gt;50% probability per year)
        
        - Calculate RISK_SCORE = SEVERITY × LIKELIHOOD
        - Risk scoring guides prioritization:
          * 1-4: Low risk (routine mitigation)
          * 5-9: Moderate risk (specific controls required)
          * 10-15: High risk (robust controls and monitoring required)
          * 16-25: Very High risk (may require design change or operational constraints)
      </details>
    </instruction>

    <instruction id="5">
      <title>Identify Causes for Each Hazard</title>
      <details>
        - For each hazard, brainstorm and list credible root causes
        - Root causes should trace back to:
          * Equipment failures (valve sticking, pump cavitation, loss of seal)
          * Human errors (wrong valve opened, incorrect setpoint, maintenance error)
          * Process upsets (feed composition change, temperature spike, pressure transient)
          * Utility failures (cooling water loss, air supply loss, power failure)
          * Control system failures (transmitter fault, controller malfunction, signal loss)
          * Design weaknesses (inadequate relief capacity, poor layout, single-point-of-failure)
        - Aim for 3-5 credible causes per hazard
        - Reference specific stream IDs, equipment tags, or control elements where relevant
        - Use language that is technical but accessible to engineers and managers
      </details>
    </instruction>

    <instruction id="6">
      <title>Identify Consequences for Each Hazard</title>
      <details>
        - For each hazard, trace forward to identify potential consequences
        - Consequences should address:
          * Immediate effects on the process (temperature rise, pressure spike, flow change)
          * Propagation to downstream equipment or systems
          * Safety impacts (worker exposure, burn risk, inhalation hazard)
          * Environmental impacts (release to atmosphere, spill to ground)
          * Operational impacts (equipment damage, loss of product, downtime)
          * Financial impacts (repair costs, lost production, penalties)
        - Be specific and quantitative where possible (e.g., "Outlet temperature exceeds 50°C," "Pressure relief valve opens at 5 barg")
        - Reference stream properties and equipment specifications (stream IDs, equipment tags)
        - Explain the mechanism of how consequence arises from the hazard
      </details>
    </instruction>

    <instruction id="7">
      <title>Identify and Propose Mitigations</title>
      <details>
        - For each hazard, identify both:
          * PREVENTION measures (eliminate or reduce likelihood of the deviation)
          * CONTROL/MITIGATION measures (detect deviation and respond before consequences occur)
          * CONSEQUENCE MITIGATION (limit impact if deviation occurs despite prevention and control)
        - Mitigations should be:
          * Feasible to implement during design or operation
          * Cost-effective relative to risk reduction
          * Verifiable and testable
          * Aligned with industry best practice and standards
        - Examples of mitigation strategies:
          * Redundant equipment (dual pumps, multiple sensors, backup systems)
          * Automatic controls (pressure relief, temperature shutdown, flow cutoff)
          * Instrumentation and alarms (high/low temperature, pressure, level alarms)
          * Procedural controls (operating procedures, maintenance protocols, emergency response)
          * Design features (relief capacity, isolation barriers, containment systems)
          * Training (operator training, emergency response drills)
        - Aim for 3-4 mitigations per hazard, covering multiple layers of protection
        - Reference specific equipment or control elements where applicable
      </details>
    </instruction>

    <instruction id="8">
      <title>Populate Notes and Cross-References</title>
      <details>
        - For each hazard, provide concise notes capturing:
          * Stream IDs directly impacted by the hazard (e.g., "Streams 1001/1002 and equipment E-101 impacted")
          * Critical equipment or control elements involved
          * Regulatory or compliance considerations (e.g., "PSM/RMP applicability")
          * References to standards or guidelines (ASME, API, NFPA, etc.)
          * Known industry precedents or lessons learned
          * Assumptions or data gaps requiring validation in detailed design
        - Keep notes brief but informative (2-3 sentences per hazard)
        - Use technical language appropriate for process safety professionals
      </details>
    </instruction>

    <instruction id="9">
      <title>Assess Overall Risk Posture</title>
      <details>
        - After identifying individual hazards, synthesize findings into overall assessment
        - Determine OVERALL RISK LEVEL:
          * LOW: All hazards &lt;10 risk score; no significant single points of failure; adequate inherent safety margins
          * MEDIUM: Mix of low/moderate hazards (5-15 risk scores); some single-point failures present; standard controls required
          * HIGH: Multiple hazards with &gt;10 risk scores; significant single-point failures; robust controls needed; potential design concerns
          * CRITICAL: Hazards with risk &gt;20; major single-point failures; design changes may be needed
        
        - Identify common risk drivers or patterns across multiple hazards
        - Assess adequacy of control layers and independence
        - Consider cascading or common-cause failure scenarios
        - Evaluate whether current design approach adequately manages identified risks
      </details>
    </instruction>

    <instruction id="10">
      <title>Generate Compliance and Follow-Up Actions</title>
      <details>
        - Based on identified hazards and risk posture, develop list of:
          * Design verification actions (e.g., "Confirm relief valve sizing for temperature excursion scenario")
          * Control/instrumentation requirements (e.g., "Install redundant temperature transmitters on E-101 outlet")
          * Operational requirements (e.g., "Develop emergency operating procedure for loss of cooling water")
          * Testing and validation actions (e.g., "Perform failure mode testing on temperature control valve")
          * Training and documentation needs (e.g., "Develop operator training on startup/shutdown procedures")
          * Compliance checklist items (e.g., "Confirm ASME compliance for relief valve design")
        
        - Frame actions as specific, actionable, and verifiable tasks
        - Prioritize based on risk reduction value
        - Assign responsibility or phase (design, commissioning, operations)
        - Use language appropriate for project management and compliance tracking
      </details>
    </instruction>

    <instruction id="11">
      <title>Format Output as Pure Markdown</title>
      <details>
        - Output ONLY Markdown-formatted text—no XML, JSON, or code fences
        - Use standard Markdown syntax:
          * # for main section headers
          * ## for hazard headers (numbered)
          * **bold** for field labels (Severity, Likelihood, etc.)
          * - for bullet lists
          * | for optional tables
        - Start with "## Hazards" header
        - Include each hazard as a subsection with number and title
        - Format each hazard consistently:
          * **Severity:** | **Likelihood:** | **Risk Score:**
          * **Causes:** section with bullet list
          * **Consequences:** section with bullet list
          * **Mitigations:** section with bullet list
          * **Notes:** section with relevant cross-references
        - End with "## Overall Assessment" header
        - Include **Risk Level:** and **Compliance Notes:** sections
        - Do NOT include code blocks, triple backticks, or XML/JSON formatting
        - Do NOT include introductory or concluding prose outside the structured sections
      </details>
    </instruction>

    <instruction id="12">
      <title>Use TBD Appropriately</title>
      <details>
        - Use "TBD" (To Be Determined) ONLY when:
          * Critical data is genuinely unavailable or unspecified in design documents
          * The data point is important but cannot be reasonably estimated
          * The data will be determined in a later project phase
        - Do NOT use "TBD" as a placeholder for information that can be reasonably inferred or estimated
        - For most process safety assessments, sufficient data should exist to make reasoned estimates
        - If uncertain, document the assumption in the Notes section

    <expected_markdown_output>## Preliminary HAZOP-Style Assessment

### 1. Loss of Cooling Water Flow

**Severity:** 3 | **Likelihood:** 3 | **Risk Score:** 9

**Causes:**
- Cooling water control valve XV-201 fails closed due to solenoid malfunction or manual valve isolation
- Plant cooling water utility header pressure drops during scheduled maintenance or unplanned failure
- Blockage or fouling in cooling water supply line upstream of E-101
- Pump cavitation in cooling water circulation system (low suction pressure or high temperature return)

**Consequences:**
- Ethanol outlet temperature (Stream 1002) rises above 50°C, approaching the 70°C alarm setpoint
- Reduced heat transfer duty forces ethanol to enter storage at higher temperature, increasing vapor losses
- Potential overpressure condition in downstream storage tank T-201 if vapor generation exceeds vent capacity
- Thermal stress on E-101 tubes may cause stress corrosion cracking in ethanol-water service
- Prolonged operation could trigger high-temperature shutdown, halting production

**Mitigations:**
- Install redundant cooling water supply pumps with automatic switchover logic activated by low-pressure alarm on supply header (recommend pressure switch at &lt;2.0 barg)
- Add continuous high-temperature alarm (TAH-101) on E-101 outlet with manual intervention trigger at 50°C and automatic shutdown at 60°C
- Equip cooling water supply with pressure relief valve set at 3.5 barg to protect against supply transients
- Implement preventive maintenance program for cooling water system including quarterly strainer inspection and annual cooling tower cleaning
- Develop operator procedure for manual switchover to backup cooling water source if automated switchover fails

**Notes:**
Streams 1001/1002 and equipment E-101 directly impacted; verify relief valve sizing and setpoint for the downstream storage tank under elevated temperature scenarios. Consider dual temperature transmitters on E-101 outlet for redundancy. This hazard is a known risk in ethanol processing per NFPA guidelines.

### 2. Overpressure in Product Transfer Line

**Severity:** 4 | **Likelihood:** 2 | **Risk Score:** 8

**Causes:**
- Product discharge check valve CV-102 (downstream of P-101) sticks open in reverse, trapping pressure when downstream isolating valve closes
- Pump discharge valve XV-103 is left open during manual line purging or maintenance, and pressurized cooling water inadvertently backflows into product line
- P-101 discharge line becomes partially blocked by scale or particle accumulation, causing pressure to rise toward relief valve setpoint
- Storage tank T-201 inlet isolation valve XV-201 is left closed due to maintenance error, trapping pressurized ethanol in transfer line (Stream 1003)

**Consequences:**
- Pressure in Line 1003 and P-101 discharge can exceed 5 barg, approaching relief valve setpoint and stressing hose and fitting connections
- Potential rupture or leak of ethanol from high-pressure connections or faulty welds, creating vapor space hazard near ignition sources
- If relief valve is blocked or malfunctions, uncontrolled pressure release via rupture could spray ethanol over surrounding equipment
- Exposure of operators to high-pressure spray and inhalation of ethanol vapors

**Mitigations:**
- Install pressure relief valve (PRV) on P-101 discharge set at 4.0 barg with capacity to handle full pump flow (redundancy recommended if duty is critical)
- Install isolation ball valve (XV-201) between transfer line outlet and storage tank inlet with lockout/tagout (LOTO) provision and verification checklist
- Add low-point drain on transfer line (1003) upstream of storage inlet to prevent vapor accumulation during shutdown
- Implement pressure monitoring on pump discharge with low-pressure alarm (&lt;0.5 barg) to indicate pump failure or suction loss
- Conduct annual proof-test of PRV per ASME code to ensure setpoint integrity and flow capacity

**Notes:**
Equipment P-101 and Stream 1003 at risk. Relief valve sizing must account for full pump capacity (15 kW motor power) and thermal expansion effects. Recommend annual inspection of discharge piping for corrosion, particularly at high-stress connection points. ASME Section VIII Div 1 compliance required for pressure relief design.

### 3. Ethanol Vapor Release from Storage Tank Vent

**Severity:** 3 | **Likelihood:** 2 | **Risk Score:** 6

**Causes:**
- Cooling water loss causes ethanol outlet temperature to exceed 50°C, increasing vapor pressure in storage tank T-201 above vent capacity
- Ethanol storage tank T-201 vent line becomes partially blocked by ice formation (if outdoor vent exposed to freezing temperatures) or by debris accumulation
- Vent line size is inadequate for the duty specified (internal volume, heat load, ambient temperature extremes)
- Operating temperature higher than design basis due to process upset or seasonal ambient temperature change

**Consequences:**
- Ethanol vapors are released to atmosphere, creating:
  * Occupational health hazard for nearby workers (eye/respiratory irritation, CNS effects at high concentrations)
  * Environmental air emission requiring compliance with local air quality regulations and potentially triggering reporting obligations
  * Vapor cloud in vicinity of storage tank—fire/explosion hazard if vapor concentration reaches flammable limits (3–19% ethanol in air)
- Potential overpressure in tank if vent becomes completely blocked, risking tank rupture or seal failure

**Mitigations:**
- Size storage tank vent (including piping) to handle maximum vapor generation rate at the highest expected outlet temperature and ambient condition; use ASME relief sizing procedure
- Route vent to enclosed vapor recovery/abatement system (e.g., thermal oxidizer or activated carbon bed) to capture ethanol vapors and minimize atmospheric release
- Install continuous level and pressure transmitters on storage tank T-201 with high-pressure alarm at 1.0 barg to alert operators to vent blockage
- Trace or heat-trace vent line if installed in outdoor or cold environment to prevent ice formation during winter operation
- Implement preventive maintenance: quarterly inspection of vent line for debris, ice, or corrosion; annual cleaning or replacement of any adsorption media

**Notes:**
Stream 1003 (product transfer to T-201) and equipment T-201 involved. Verify vent sizing in detailed design phase and confirm compliance with local air emissions regulations (VOC limits, source registration). Consider installing automated vent valve closure during non-operation to minimize fugitive emissions. Industry precedent: several ethanol plants have installed vapor recovery systems to meet air quality standards and recover product value.

### 4. Temperature Transmitter Failure and Loss of Process Control

**Severity:** 3 | **Likelihood:** 2 | **Risk Score:** 6

**Causes:**
- Primary temperature transmitter TT-101 on E-101 outlet (Stream 1002) fails and reads false low temperature (below 40°C) or loses signal
- Transmitter wiring is cut or corroded due to installation error or mechanical vibration, resulting in loss of signal to controller
- Temperature controller TC-101 calibration drift causes incorrect temperature setpoint (e.g., setpoint gradually shifts from 40°C to 50°C)
- Pneumatic line to temperature control valve XV-201 ruptures or becomes disconnected, leaving valve in last known position

**Consequences:**
- Control system has no feedback that ethanol outlet temperature has risen; operators are unaware of cooling failure until high-temperature alarm activates (if setpoint is correct)
- Ethanol outlet temperature can rise to 50°C or higher before manual intervention occurs, causing the thermal stress and vapor release scenarios described above
- Delay in operator response increases risk of downstream consequences (overpressure in storage, thermal damage to E-101)
- If backup alarm (TAH-101) is also disabled or setpoint is incorrect, operators may not detect the upset until equipment damage occurs

**Consequences:**
- Install dual redundant temperature transmitters on E-101 outlet (Stream 1002) with automatic signal selection to backup transmitter on controller input
- Configure high-temperature alarm (TAH-101) independent of primary control system, with local annunciation and hardwired shutdown signal to cooling water pump (fail-safe logic)
- Calibrate and proof-test all temperature transmitters during commissioning and annually thereafter per manufacturer specification; maintain calibration certificates
- Implement preventive maintenance: quarterly visual inspection of transmitter connections for corrosion or mechanical damage; annual transmitter removal and bench calibration
- Develop operator procedure for manual temperature monitoring (e.g., read thermometer on sight glass) as backup if electronic instrumentation fails
- Install signal quality monitor on controller that alerts operator if transmitter signal variance exceeds expected range or signal is absent

**Notes:**
Equipment E-101, Stream 1002, and control system TC-101/TAH-101 involved. Temperature transmitter redundancy is a defense-in-depth measure to ensure process visibility even if one device fails. Recommend hardwired, independent high-temperature alarm independent of programmable logic controller (PLC) to maintain safety function in case of PLC software failure. This reflects best practice for critical process parameters in hazardous chemical processes.

### 5. Utility Pressure Swing and Pump Cavitation

**Severity:** 2 | **Likelihood:** 3 | **Risk Score:** 6

**Causes:**
- P-101 suction pressure drops below atmosphere due to line restrictions, elevated inlet temperature (reducing suction head), or high ambient temperature reducing vapor pressure margin
- Cooling water system failure on downstream equipment draws high flow, reducing pressure available to P-101 suction header
- Startup procedure allows pump to start with air in suction line (improper priming), causing cavitation and loss of prime
