    <instruction id="1">
      <title>Conduct Critical Design Review</title>
      <details>
        - Systematically review all components of the design package:
          * Requirements specification: confirm all stated requirements are addressed in the design
          * Design basis: verify design basis parameters are consistent with equipment sizing and stream properties
          * PFD: validate equipment connectivity, stream routing, and utility interactions
          * Equipment list: confirm sizing is reasonable, design margins are adequate, and equipment types are appropriate for service
          * Stream data: verify mass balances close, component balances are consistent, and properties (T, P, compositions) are realistic
          * HAZOP: assess completeness of hazard identification, reasonableness of risk scores, and adequacy of proposed mitigations
        
        - Check for internal consistency:
          * Stream inlet/outlet properties match equipment inlet/outlet connections
          * Equipment design criteria (heat duty, volume, flow) are consistent with stream properties
          * Control systems and instrumentation are specified for critical process parameters
          * Safety mitigations address identified HAZOP hazards
          * Utility requirements (cooling water, steam, electrical, inert gas) are within site capability
        
        - Identify technical gaps or concerns that should be addressed before proceeding to FEED or that can be resolved during FEED with acceptable risk
      </details>
    </instruction>

    <instruction id="2">
      <title>Assess Financial Feasibility</title>
      <details>
        - Populate financial metrics table:
          * CAPEX (capital expenditure): extract from cost estimates if provided; if not provided, estimate from equipment sizing using industry benchmarks
            - Heat exchangers: $2k–$5k per m² depending on type and material
            - Pumps: $15k–$50k depending on power and design pressure
            - Vessels: $5k–$20k per m³ depending on material and pressure rating
            - Columns: $20k–$100k+ per tray depending on size and complexity
            - Installed cost multiplier: typically 2–3× purchased equipment cost for skid/module; 3–5× for grassroots facility
          * OPEX (operating expenditure): extract utility costs (electricity, steam, cooling water), maintenance labor, spare parts
            - If not provided, estimate from energy balance: kW × operating hours × $/kWh
            - Maintenance: typically 2–5% of installed equipment cost per year
          * Contingency percentage: assess uncertainty in cost estimate
            - Conceptual design stage: typically 20–30% contingency recommended
            - If design is relatively straightforward (heat exchanger, simple equipment): 15–20% contingency acceptable
            - If design has novel features or significant uncertainties: 25–30%+ contingency justified
        
        - Calculate total project cost with contingency: (CAPEX + OPEX annual × project life assumption) × (1 + contingency %)
        - Assess financial viability relative to business case and capital availability
        - Flag any cost drivers or assumptions requiring validation in detailed design
      </details>
    </instruction>

    <instruction id="3">
      <title>Render Approval Decision</title>
      <details>
        - Select one of four approval statuses:
          * APPROVED: Design is technically sound, meets requirements, has acceptable risk profile, and is ready for FEED phase with no conditional requirements
          * CONDITIONAL APPROVAL: Design is viable but requires specific conditions to be met before FEED can proceed (e.g., vendor quotes, design verification, risk mitigation confirmation)
          * HOLD FOR REVISION: Design has significant gaps or deficiencies requiring rework before stage-gate can be approved (e.g., major cost overruns, missing safety mitigations, non-compliance with standards)
          * REJECTED: Design is not viable or does not meet business/technical requirements; recommend alternative approach or restart conceptual design
        
        - Provide one clear, concise sentence of rationale explaining the approval decision
        - Rationale should reference specific technical, financial, or compliance factors driving the decision
        - If Conditional Approval, specify the conditions that must be met
      </details>
    </instruction>

    <instruction id="4">
      <title>Summarize Residual Risks and Compliance Items</title>
      <details>
        - Identify all outstanding risks, design gaps, and compliance items that remain after the conceptual design phase
        - Categorize by severity and required timeline:
          * Critical items (must be resolved before design approval or commissioning): note as "Pre-FEED" or "Pre-Commissioning"
          * Important items (should be resolved during FEED, with resolution plan agreed): note timeline in FEED phase
          * Minor items (can be addressed during detailed design): note as low priority
        
        - For each item, provide:
          * Clear description of the gap or risk
          * Reference to specific stream IDs, equipment tags, or HAZOP hazards where applicable
          * Proposed resolution approach
          * Owner and target timeline
        
        - Keep items specific and actionable—avoid vague statements like "confirm design safety" or "verify cost estimate"
        - Examples of well-stated items:
          * "Confirm cooling water supply pressure can sustain 2.5 barg at full flow (24,000 kg/h) during peak summer conditions; verify with plant utilities by end of FEED Phase 1"
          * "Obtain vendor quote for E-101 shell-and-tube heat exchanger with 150 m² area, 316L stainless steel; confirm delivery schedule for procurement planning"
          * "Complete detailed HAZOP for control system failures; add redundant temperature transmitters on critical monitoring points as recommended in preliminary HAZOP"
      </details>
    </instruction>

    <instruction id="5">
      <title>Develop Implementation Plan</title>
      <details>
        - Outline the immediate next steps to advance the project from conceptual design approval to FEED phase commencement
        - Provide exactly three sequenced, actionable implementation steps
        - Each step should:
          * Have a clear, specific objective (not vague)
          * Include estimated duration or target completion date
          * Identify responsible owner or function (Design Engineer, Procurement, Safety, etc.)
          * Reference relevant design package elements or HAZOP findings
          * Build logically toward FEED phase entry
        
        - Typical sequence for chemical process projects:
          1. Issue RFQ to vendors, obtain quotes, finalize cost estimates, update financial authorization
          2. Conduct detailed design kick-off meeting, assign resources, establish FEED scope and schedule
          3. Issue P&IDs, instrument list, and safety control strategy for preliminary review
        
        - For smaller or simpler projects:
          1. Finalize equipment specifications and prepare procurement documents
          2. Resolve critical design gaps (e.g., vendor confirmation, site conditions verification)
          3. Issue detailed design request for quote and schedule kick-off
        
        - Tailor steps to the specific project context and design complexity

    </instruction>

    <instruction id="6">
      <title>Populate Approval Memo Template</title>
      <details>
        - Use the exact Markdown template structure provided below
        - Sections must appear in this order:
          1. Executive Summary (Approval Status, Key Rationale)
          2. Financial Outlook (table with CAPEX, OPEX, Contingency, Total Estimated Cost)
          3. Implementation Plan (three numbered steps)
          4. Final Notes (residual risks, compliance gaps, design verification items, assumptions)
        
        - Do NOT add introductory preamble or concluding remarks
        - Do NOT include code blocks or code fences
        - Start directly with "## Executive Summary" header
        - End with "## Final Notes" section
      </details>
    </instruction>

    <instruction id="7">
      <title>Document Assumptions and Estimates</title>
      <details>
        - In the Final Notes section, explicitly flag any values or assumptions that are estimates rather than actuals
        - Examples of estimates requiring flagging:
          * "CAPEX estimate based on 2.5× equipment cost multiplier (industry average for modular skid) pending detailed engineering cost breakdown"
          * "OPEX electricity cost assumed at $0.08/kWh pending confirmation of regional utility rates"
          * "Contingency set at 20% based on straightforward heat exchanger design; may increase to 25% if custom materials or special alloys required"
          * "Equipment pricing estimates based on mid-2024 vendor quotes; final pricing subject to escalation adjustment and detailed specs"
        
        - For each assumption, indicate:
          * What the assumption is
          * Why it was made (data not available, industry standard, etc.)
          * How it will be validated or refined (e.g., "pending vendor RFQ," "during FEED detailed design")
      </details>
    </instruction>

    <instruction id="8">
      <title>Output Discipline and Format</title>
      <details>
        - Output ONLY Markdown-formatted text—no XML, JSON, tables in code blocks, or explanatory prose
        - Use standard Markdown syntax:
          * ## for section headers (main sections only)
          * **bold** for field labels
          * - for bullet lists
          * | for tables (Markdown native format, not HTML or code)
        - Start with "## Executive Summary" (no introductory preamble)
        - End with "## Final Notes" (no concluding remarks)
        - Do NOT wrap any content in triple backticks or code blocks
        - Do NOT include supplementary narrative, rationale, or explanatory text outside the structured sections
        - Approval memo should be concise, professional, and suitable for distribution to executive steering committee
      </details>
    </instruction>

    <instruction id="9">
      <title>Cross-Reference Design Package Elements</title>
      <details>
        - Throughout the memo, reference specific elements from the design package to support conclusions:
          * Reference stream IDs (e.g., "Stream 1001 supplies 10,000 kg/h ethanol at 80°C")
          * Reference equipment tags (e.g., "E-101 requires 150 m² area per sizing calculations")
          * Reference HAZOP findings (e.g., "Hazard #1 (Loss of Cooling Water Flow) is addressed by installing redundant cooling water pumps")
          * Reference financial elements (e.g., "CAPEX of $1.2M is based on equipment list in the design package")
        
        - Cross-referencing demonstrates that the approval decision is grounded in the detailed design package and builds confidence in the gatekeeping decision
        - Keep cross-references brief and specific—do not repeat large sections of the design package
      </details>
    </instruction>

    <instruction id="10">
      <title>Flag Conditional Requirements if Applicable</title>
      <details>
        - If approval status is CONDITIONAL APPROVAL, clearly state all conditions that must be satisfied before FEED authorization:
          * Specific conditions should be concrete and verifiable (e.g., "Obtain written confirmation from Plant Operations that cooling water supply of 24,000 kg/h at 2.5 barg can be sustained during peak summer operation")
          * Conditions should have a target resolution date (e.g., "by end of Week 2 of FEED Phase 1")
          * Conditions should identify responsible party (e.g., "Process Engineer to coordinate with Plant Operations and document in writing")
        
        - Include conditions in Final Notes section or as a distinct subsection of Implementation Plan
        - Ensure that all conditions are achievable during FEED phase and do not require re-doing conceptual design

- **Utility Contract Verification (Pre-FEED):** Plant Operations must confirm that the 24,000 kg/h cooling water supply required for E-101 can be sustained at 2.5 barg during peak summer conditions. If summer water shortage is anticipated, alternative cooling strategy (air-cooled exchanger) should be evaluated. Coordinate with Plant Operations by end of Week 2.
- **Vendor Cost Estimates (Pre-FEED):** CAPEX figure of $1.2M is based on industry benchmarks (2.5× equipment cost multiplier) pending detailed RFQ responses. Finalize equipment quotes during FEED Phase 1 to confirm budget authorization.
- **HAZOP Hazard #1 Mitigation (FEED Phase 1):** Confirm design of redundant cooling water pumps with automatic switchover logic. Obtain equipment datasheets for backup pump and verify control system design in coordination with instrument engineers.
- **Corrosion Coupon Program (Pre-Commissioning):** Install and monitor corrosion coupons in E-101 tubes (ethanol-water service, 316L stainless steel) as recommended in preliminary safety review; establish baseline corrosion rate before full operation.
- **ASME Code Compliance (FEED Phase 1):** Confirm that E-101 pressure relief valve is sized per ASME Section VIII Div 1 and that hydrostatic test procedures are documented; obtain third-party engineering certification for pressure equipment.
- **Stream Property Assumptions (FEED Validation):** Design assumes ethanol Cp = 2.44 kJ/kg-K over 40–80°C range; confirm with detailed thermodynamic property data from process simulation during FEED Phase 1. If Cp varies significantly, recalculate E-101 area and cost.

    <design_package>
      <summary>Ethanol cooling system project: E-101 shell-and-tube heat exchanger (150 m² area) cools 10,000 kg/h ethanol from 80°C to 40°C; P-101 centrifugal pump (15 kW motor) transfers product to atmospheric storage tank T-201 at 2.45 barg. Design relies on plant cooling water utility (24,000 kg/h, 25°C inlet, 2.5 barg). HAZOP identified four credible hazards with risk scores ranging from 6–9. Preliminary cost estimate: CAPEX $1.2M, OPEX $0.35M/year. Design package includes equipment list, stream data (JSON), PFD, and HAZOP assessment.</summary>
    </design_package>

    <expected_markdown_output>## Executive Summary

- **Approval Status:** Conditional Approval
- **Key Rationale:** Design is technically sound and meets stated requirements; full approval contingent upon confirmation of cooling water utility capacity and completion of preliminary P&ID incorporating HAZOP Hazard #1 mitigations by end of Week 2 FEED Phase 1.

**Conditions for FEED Authorization:**
- Obtain written confirmation from Plant Operations that 24,000 kg/h cooling water supply at 2.5 barg can be sustained during peak summer operation (peak season utility profile TBD in FEED).
- Issue preliminary P&ID with redundant temperature transmitters on E-101 outlet (Stream 1002), independent high-temperature alarm (TAH-101), and automatic cooling water pump switchover logic as recommended in HAZOP assessment.
- Finalize equipment cost estimates from at least two qualified vendors for E-101 and P-101 to validate CAPEX budget of $1.2M.

## Financial Outlook

| Metric | Estimate (USD) |
|--------|----------------|
| CAPEX (millions) | 1.2 |
| OPEX (millions per year) | 0.35 |
| Contingency (%) | 20 |
| Total Estimated Cost | 1.98 |

## Implementation Plan

1. **Finalize Equipment Specifications and Vendor Quotes:** Complete detailed specifications for E-101 (150 m² TEMA 1-2 shell-and-tube, 316L construction per ethanol service requirements) and P-101 (15 kW centrifugal pump, 2.45 barg discharge); issue RFQ to three qualified vendors. Obtain cost quotes and delivery commitments confirming budget alignment by end of Week 4 FEED Phase 1. Owner: Procurement and Process Design Engineer.

2. **Conduct FEED Kick-Off and Safety Integration:** Schedule FEED phase kick-off meeting with Design, Process, Safety, Operations, and Procurement stakeholders; establish FEED scope, schedule, and safety review protocol; confirm regulatory compliance path (ASME code compliance, PSM applicability). Issue FEED project charter and resource plan by end of Week 1. Owner: Project Manager.

3. **Develop Preliminary P&ID and Control Strategy:** Prepare detailed P&ID incorporating HAZOP recommendations: redundant temperature transmitters on Stream 1002 outlet, independent high-temperature alarm (TAH-101) with hardwired shutdown to cooling water pump, automatic switchover logic for dual cooling water pumps, and relief valve design on pump discharge (Stream 1003). Issue P&ID for internal review and vendor feedback by end of Week 6 FEED Phase 1. Owner: Process Control Engineer.

## Final Notes

- **Utility Capacity Verification (Critical - Pre-FEED):** Plant Operations must confirm in writing that the required 24,000 kg/h cooling water supply can be sustained at 2.5 barg during peak summer conditions. Current design assumes adequate cooling water availability year-round; if summer supply is constrained, an alternative air-cooled heat exchanger design should be evaluated in parallel during early FEED. Coordinate with Plant Utilities by end of Week 2 FEED Phase 1.

- **CAPEX Estimate Basis (Cost Assumption):** The $1.2M CAPEX figure is based on industry benchmarks (2.5× equipment cost multiplier for modular skid; includes purchased equipment, installation labor, piping, instrumentation, and initial startup testing). This estimate is pending detailed RFQ responses from equipment vendors. Finalize equipment quotes during FEED Phase 1 (Week 4 target) to confirm authorization budget. If vendor quotes exceed $1.2M by >10%, escalation reserve may be required.

- **OPEX Estimate (Cost Assumption):** The $0.35M/year OPEX figure includes estimated electricity costs ($0.15M based on pump motor 15 kW operating 8,000 hours/year at $0.08/kWh), cooling water utility ($0.12M estimated at site rates TBD), maintenance labor and spare parts ($0.08M based on 2% of installed equipment cost). Confirm regional utility rates and maintenance cost assumptions with Finance during FEED Phase 1.

- **Contingency Justification (20%):** Contingency of 20% is appropriate for a modular heat exchanger and pump system with relatively straightforward design; contingency may be increased to 25% if detailed engineering reveals additional complexity (e.g., special corrosion-resistant materials, extended delivery lead times, or site integration challenges). Contingency will be reassessed at end of FEED Phase 1.

- **HAZOP Hazard #1 Mitigation (Pre-FEED Design Verification):** Hazard "Loss of Cooling Water Flow" (risk score 9) is the highest-priority safety item. Design must include: (a) dual cooling water supply pumps with automatic switchover on low-pressure alarm (&lt;2.0 barg), (b) high-temperature alarm (TAH-101) on E-101 outlet with independent hardwired shutdown signal, and (c) pressure relief valve on E-101 shell side set at 3.5 barg. Confirm detailed design of these safeguards and submit equipment datasheets for P&ID integration by end of Week 3 FEED Phase 1.

- **Regulatory and Compliance Path (Pre-FEED):** Confirm applicability of ASME Section VIII Division 1 for pressure equipment design and relief valve sizing. Clarify whether process falls under PSM (Process Safety Management) or RMP (Risk Management Plan) regulatory scope; if applicable, confirm that detailed HAZOP will be conducted during FEED Phase 1 with independent safety review. Coordinate with EHS (Environmental Health and Safety) by end of Week 1 FEED Phase 1.

- **Stream Property Assumptions (FEED Validation):** Design calculations assume ethanol specific heat (Cp) = 2.44 kJ/kg-K over 40–80°C range; composition is 95 mol% ethanol, 5 mol% water. Confirm these properties with detailed thermodynamic simulation during FEED Phase 1. If actual Cp or composition varies significantly from assumptions, recalculate E-101 heat transfer area and associated cost impact.

- **Corrosion Monitoring Program (Pre-Commissioning):** Safety assessment recommends installation of corrosion coupons in E-101 tubes (ethanol-water service, 316L stainless steel material). Coupons must be exposed at process start-up and monitored quarterly to establish baseline corrosion rate and validate material selection. Document coupon data and maintenance protocol in equipment manual and operations procedures.

- **Equipment Delivery and Procurement Risk (Pre-FEED):** Obtain vendor lead time estimates during RFQ phase (Week 2–4 FEED Phase 1). If any critical equipment has lead times exceeding 12 weeks, early procurement or expedited ordering may be required to meet project schedule. Update project schedule with equipment procurement critical path by end of Week 4 FEED Phase 1.

- **Site Integration and Installation Coordination (FEED Phase 2):** Verify that the proposed cooler module skid (E-101 and P-101) can be physically integrated at the planned site location adjacent to existing storage tank T-201. Confirm utility tie-in points (cooling water inlet/outlet, electrical, instrument air) are accessible and adequately sized. Conduct site walkdown during early FEED Phase 2 to validate layout and identify any installation constraints.

- **Future Design Considerations:** If project scope expands beyond simple cooling (e.g., addition of storage tank upgrade, utility infrastructure modification, or multi-stream cooling system), revised conceptual design and stage-gate review will be required.
