    "research_concepts": "\n\n## Concept 1: Amine Scrubbing Process (MEA)\n**Feasibility Score:** 8\n\n### Risks\n- Technical Risk: MEA degradation due to SOx/NOx and oxygen in flue gas can lead to corrosive byproducts and reduced capture efficiency. Foaming in the absorber can cause operational instability. High energy demand for regeneration is a significant concern, especially for variable flue gas compositions.\n- Economic Risk: High OPEX due to energy consumption for regeneration and amine make-up. Capital costs for large-scale absorption/regeneration towers can be substantial. Pre-treatment requirements for various burner types (e.g., higher SOx removal for coal burners vs. natural gas) add complexity and cost.\n- Safety Risk: Amine solutions are corrosive and can pose health risks upon exposure. Amine emissions (volatile organic compounds) are an environmental concern. Thermal and oxidative degradation products can be toxic.\n\n### Recommendations\n- Investigate advanced amine solvents or blends with lower regeneration energy requirements and higher resistance to degradation from flue gas contaminants.\n- Develop robust and adaptable pre-treatment modules that can economically handle a wide range of SOx/NOx and particulate concentrations from different burner types without over-designing for the cleanest streams.\n- Model the economic impact of variable flue gas composition and flow rates on overall energy consumption and amine degradation to provide clearer OPEX projections.\n\n## Concept 2: Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) with Tailored Adsorbents\n**Feasibility Score:** 7\n\n### Risks\n- Technical Risk: Adsorbent long-term stability and performance in the presence of varying flue gas contaminants (SOx, NOx, moisture) is critical and often untested at scale for diverse burner types. Regeneration efficiency and complete desorption across varied flue gas conditions could be challenging. Pressure drop across beds can lead to increased power consumption.\n- Economic Risk: Adsorbent cost can be high, particularly for tailored varieties. Energy consumption for vacuum pumps (VSA) or compressors (PSA) can be significant. Cycle times and bed switching mechanisms need to be highly robust and automated for modular deployment, potentially increasing CAPEX.\n- Safety Risk: Handling of solid adsorbents may involve dust, but generally lower safety risks compared to liquid solvents. Potential for hot spots in beds if not designed properly, though less common with CO2 capture.\n\n### Recommendations\n- Focus R&D on developing robust, contaminant-resistant adsorbents with high selectivity and capacity specifically for mixed flue gas streams, ideally with long lifespans.\n- Develop advanced control strategies for dynamic pressure cycling to optimize performance under varying flue gas flow rates and CO2 concentrations, ensuring modularity.\n- Conduct pilot-scale testing with real flue gas from diverse burner types to validate long-term adsorbent stability and demonstrate energy efficiency claims.\n\n## Concept 3: Membrane Separation Process\n**Feasibility Score:** 6\n\n### Risks\n- Technical Risk: Membrane selectivity and permeability for CO2 separation under varying flue gas conditions (temperature, pressure, contaminant presence) can be challenging. Membrane fouling by particulates, condensed water, and chemical attack by SOx/NOx can significantly reduce performance and lifetime. Achieving high CO2 purity and recovery simultaneously often requires multiple stages and significant compression, impacting efficiency.\n- Economic Risk: High capital cost for membrane modules, especially for high-flux, durable materials. Energy penalty associated with feed gas compression and potential vacuum on the permeate side. Purity and recovery targets may necessitate complex multi-stage designs, increasing CAPEX and OPEX.\n- Safety Risk: Typically low safety risk as it's a physical separation process with no hazardous chemicals. Potential for leaks at high pressure.\n\n### Recommendations\n- Priority investment in R&D for next-generation membrane materials with enhanced CO2 selectivity and permeability, alongside high tolerance to typical flue gas contaminants (SOx, NOx, water vapor).\n- Develop modular membrane skid designs that allow for easy replacement of individual modules and flexible staging to optimize for varying CO2 concentrations and purity requirements.\n- Pilot-scale demonstration is crucial to validate anti-fouling strategies and long-term membrane performance and lifespan under actual, variable flue gas conditions.\n\n## Concept 4: Calcium Looping (Chemical Looping Combustion Integrated Carbon Capture)\n**Feasibility Score:** 4\n\n### Risks\n- Technical Risk: High operating temperatures (850-950\u00b0C in calciner) present significant material challenges and increased risk of operational failures. Sorbent deactivation (sintering) over time, leading to reduced CO2 capture efficiency and increased fresh sorbent make-up. Complex solids handling in fluidized beds at high temperatures and large solids circulation rates. Integration with different existing burner types is highly complex, as it's more suited for new builds or major retrofits.\n- Economic Risk: Very high capital expenditure due to large-scale high-temperature reactors, solids handling systems, and air separation unit (for oxy-combustion). High operating costs associated with sorbent make-up and energy for heating. Economic viability is often tied to large-scale power generation, not smaller, modular applications.\n- Safety Risk: Handling of hot solids and high-temperature reactors poses inherent safety challenges. Risks associated with large-scale oxy-combustion and potential for operational upsets in fluidized beds.\n\n### Recommendations\n- Re-evaluate the concept's suitability for a \"modular carbon capture package for various burner types,\" as its inherent complexity and high-temperature operation make it less modular and harder to integrate into diverse existing systems. It's more of a plant-scale solution.\n- For specific, large-scale greenfield projects where integrated power generation and high CO2 capture are paramount, focus on research into more stable and active sorbents to extend sorbent lifetime and improve energy efficiency.\n- Develop simplified solid circulation and heat recovery systems that could potentially lower CAPEX if the modularity constraint is relaxed for specific very large-scale industrial applications.\n\n## Concept 5: Cryogenic Carbon Capture\n**Feasibility Score:** 5\n\n### Risks\n- Technical Risk: Extremely high energy consumption for gas compression and subsequent refrigeration to achieve cryogenic temperatures (<-100\u00b0C). Formation of solid CO2 and water ice can lead to fouling and blockage of heat exchangers and equipment. Designing heat exchangers robust against solid formation and managing phase changes reliably is complex.\n- Economic Risk: Very high OPEX due to significant power consumption for compression and cooling. High capital cost for specialized cryogenic equipment, multi-stage compressors, and robust heat exchange networks. Not easily scalable downwards to \"modular\" units without significant efficiency penalties.\n- Safety Risk: Handling of extremely cold fluids and equipment requires specialized materials and safety protocols to prevent brittle fracture. Risk of asphyxiation from concentrated CO2 leaks.\n\n### Recommendations\n- Explore innovative process configurations that integrate waste heat recovery or alternative refrigeration cycles (e.g., absorption refrigeration systems if waste heat is available) to significantly reduce the energy penalty.\n- Develop advanced anti-fouling strategies or cyclical defrosting/sublimation methods to manage solid CO2 and water ice formation, particularly for variable flue gas compositions and moisture levels.\n- Prioritize market segments where very high CO2 purity is a critical requirement and the economic value of this purity outweighs the high energy consumption, such as food-grade CO2 or specialized chemical feedstock applications. Consider hybridization with other capture technologies for bulk removal first.",
    "selected_concept_details": "\n\n## Concept Summary\n- Name: Amine Scrubbing Process (MEA)\n- Intent: To efficiently capture CO2 from diverse flue gas streams using a proven chemical absorption-desorption cycle, delivering concentrated CO2.\n- Feasibility Score (from review): 8\n\n## Process Narrative\nThe modular carbon capture package commences with feed flue gas from various burner types entering a pre-treatment section. This section is critical for addressing the varied compositions and conditions of the incoming gas. Initially, the flue gas is rapidly quenched and cooled to a suitable temperature for particulate removal via filtration or electrostatic precipitation. Following particulate removal, a dedicated desulfurization unit, likely a wet scrubber, removes SOx to prevent amine degradation and corrosion. This pre-treated and cooled flue gas then enters the absorber column, where it flows counter-currently to a descending stream of lean aqueous MEA solution. In the absorber, CO2 chemically reacts with MEA, while other non-acidic components like N2, O2, and trace CO pass through and are vented as treated flue gas. The now CO2-rich MEA solution exits the bottom of the absorber.\n\nThe rich MEA solution is pumped through a lean/rich heat exchanger, where it recovers heat from the hot lean MEA solution returning from the regenerator. It then enters the regenerator (stripper) column, which is typically operated at elevated temperatures and lower pressures. In the regenerator, heat supplied by a reboiler breaks the chemical bond between CO2 and MEA, driving off concentrated CO2. The reboiler is heated by steam, typically from an external utility source. The released CO2, along with steam, exits the top of the regenerator and passes through a condenser to separate water, which is returned to the column. The concentrated, nearly dry CO2 stream is then sent for further processing (e.g., compression, drying) or sequestration. The regenerated lean MEA solution, now hot and CO2-depleted, passes back through the lean/rich heat exchanger, is cooled, and then pumped back to the absorber, completing the amine loop. Make-up MEA and water are added as needed to compensate for losses.\n\n## Major Equipment & Roles\n| Equipment | Function | Critical Operating Notes |\n|---|---|---|\n| Flue Gas Quench/Cooler | Rapidly cools and saturates incoming flue gas; removes initial dust. | Must handle wide range of inlet temperatures/compositions; potential for acid condensate. |\n| Particulate Filter/ESP | Removes solid particulates to prevent fouling and foaming in absorber. | Requires regular cleaning or backwashing; design for varying dust loads and particle sizes. |\n| SOx Scrubber (Wet) | Removes SO2 to prevent MEA degradation and corrosion. | Requires alkali make-up (e.g., caustic soda or limestone slurry); pH control is crucial. |\n| CO2 Absorber Column | Chemically absorbs CO2 from flue gas using lean MEA solution. | Packing or trays designed for efficient gas-liquid contact; temperature control to optimize absorption; foaming detection and control. |\n| Lean/Rich Heat Exchanger | Transfers heat from hot lean MEA to cold rich MEA, improving energy efficiency. | Design for high heat transfer efficiency; susceptible to fouling by degradation products. |\n| MEA Regenerator Column | Strips CO2 from rich MEA solution by heating, regenerating lean MEA. | Operated at elevated temperature (110-120\u00b0C) and pressure (1.5-2 atm); reboiler duty is primary energy consumer. |\n| Reboiler | Supplies heat (typically steam) to regenerate MEA solution in the stripper. | Sizing is critical for regeneration efficiency; steam quality and pressure must be consistent. |\n| Regenerator Condenser | Cools overhead vapor from regenerator, condensing water and separating CO2. | Ensures minimal MEA and water loss with CO2 product; adequate cooling capacity required. |\n| MEA Circulation Pumps | Circulates lean and rich MEA solutions between absorber and regenerator. | Material selection for corrosion resistance; seal integrity to prevent losses. |\n| CO2 Compressor/Drier | Compresses and potentially dries captured CO2 for transport or storage. | Multi-stage design depending on final CO2 pressure; intercoolers for efficiency; a separate unit, not part of core capture. |\n\n## Operating Envelope\n- Design capacity: TBD (Basis will be determined by specific flue gas volumetric flow rate from representative industrial burner types, e.g., 20,000 to 100,000 Nm\u00b3/hr flue gas)\n- Key pressure levels: Flue gas inlet: slightly above atmospheric (induced by fan); Absorber: slightly above atmospheric; Regenerator: 1.5 - 2.0 bar absolute; CO2 product: TBD (dependent on end-use, potentially 100+ bar for pipeline/storage).\n- Key temperature levels: Flue gas inlet: 100-300\u00b0C (requires cooling); Pre-treated flue gas to absorber: 30-50\u00b0C; Absorber operating: 40-60\u00b0C; Rich MEA to regenerator: 100-110\u00b0C; Regenerator operating: 110-120\u00b0C; Lean MEA to absorber: 40-50\u00b0C.\n- Special utilities / additives: Steam (low to medium pressure for reboiler), Cooling Water, Anti-foaming agents, MEA make-up solution, Caustic/limestone slurry (for SOx scrubber), Corrosion inhibitors.\n\n## Risks & Safeguards\n- MEA degradation by SOx/NOx/O2 \u2014 Robust flue gas pre-treatment (high efficiency particulate, SOx, and potentially NOx removal units) and continuous monitoring of amine health.

This affects the design of the CO2 compression and drying unit.",

This gas is first drawn into the system by the **Flue Gas Fan (G-101)** to provide the necessary pressure (Stream 1002). To protect downstream amine solutions from degradation and to facilitate efficient particulate and SOx removal, the hot flue gas undergoes a crucial pre-treatment sequence. It is first cooled and saturated in the **Flue Gas Quench/Cooler (E-101)** (Stream 1003), reducing its temperature from a wide range (100-300\u00b0C) to 30-50\u00b0C using **Cooling Water (Streams 1024, 1025)**. This cooling also condenses some moisture and removes initial coarse particulates.\n\nThe cooled flue gas (Stream 1003) then passes through a **Particulate Filter/ESP (F-101)** (Stream 1004) to remove fine solid particulates (Stream 1030), preventing fouling of the absorber and foaming of the amine solution. Subsequently, the particulate-free flue gas (Stream 1004) enters the **SOx Scrubber (Wet) (R-101)**, where **SOx Scrubber Reagents (Stream 1028)**, typically an alkaline solution, remove sulfur dioxide through scrubbing. The treated SOx-free flue gas (Stream 1005), now clean and suitable for absorption, proceeds to the main **CO2 Absorber Column (C-101)**. The SOx scrubber generates a **waste effluent (Stream 1029)**.\n\nIn the **CO2 Absorber Column (C-101)**, the flue gas (Stream 1005) flows upward, counter-currently contacting a descending stream of **Lean MEA Solution (Stream 1007)**. CO2 in the flue gas reacts chemically with the MEA, forming a rich amine complex. The now CO2-lean flue gas **(Treated Flue Gas (Vent), Stream 1006)** exits the top of the absorber and is safely vented to the atmosphere. The CO2-rich MEA solution, termed **Rich MEA (Stream 1008)**, collects at the bottom of the absorber.\n\nThe **Rich MEA (Stream 1008)** is then pumped by **Rich MEA Pump (P-101)** (Stream 1009) to the **Lean/Rich Heat Exchanger (E-102)**. Here, it is preheated (Stream 1010) by recovering heat from the hot **Lean MEA (Stream 1011)** returning from the regenerator, significantly improving energy efficiency. The preheated **Rich MEA (Stream 1010)** then enters the **MEA Regenerator Column (C-102)**.\n\nIn the **Regenerator (C-102)**, the rich MEA solution is heated to elevated temperatures (110-120\u00b0C) and operated at lower pressures (1.5-2 bar abs) to reverse the CO2 absorption reaction. Heat is supplied by the **Reboiler (E-103)**, which uses **Steam (Stream 1015)** as the heating medium, returning **condensate (Stream 1016)**. Hot fluid from the regenerator bottom (**Stream 1017**) is circulated to the **Reboiler (E-103)**, and the reboiled vapors (**Stream 1018**) return to the column, providing the necessary stripping energy. This process releases concentrated CO2, along with steam, as a vapor stream **(Stream 1012)** from the top of the regenerator.\n\nThis vapor stream (Stream 1012) enters the **Regenerator Condenser (E-104)**, where **Cooling Water (Streams 1026, 1027)** condenses most of the steam, forming **Condensed Water (Stream 1013)** which collects in the **Condensate Receiver (V-101)**. This **water (Stream 1019)** is then recycled back to the regenerator to maintain water balance. The concentrated, now largely dry **CO2 (Stream 1014)** exits the condenser.\n\nThe regenerated **Lean MEA solution (Stream 1011)**, now hot and CO2-depleted, flows from the regenerator bottom back through the **Lean/Rich Heat Exchanger (E-102)**, where it transfers its heat to the incoming rich MEA. It is then further cooled to the appropriate absorber inlet temperature (40-50\u00b0C) before being pumped by **Lean MEA Pump (P-102)** (Stream 1007) back to the **Absorber (C-101)**, completing the amine loop. **Make-up MEA and water (Stream 1020)** are added via **Make-up/Reclaimer Pump (P-103)** (Stream 1021) to compensate for operational losses and maintain amine concentration.\n\nFinally, the captured **CO2 (Stream 1014)** is fed to the **CO2 Compressor (C-103)** (Stream 1022) to achieve the required pressure for transport or storage. A **CO2 Dryer (D-101)** further removes any residual moisture to meet desired purity specifications, yielding the **Dried CO2 Product (Stream 1023)**.\n\n## Notes\n- The modularity requirement is addressed by designing each unit operation as a skid-mounted module, allowing for flexible sizing and deployment based on specific flue gas characteristics from various burner types.\n- The wide range of flue gas inlet temperatures and compositions necessitates robust design of the pre-treatment section (E-101, F-101, R-101) to protect the sensitive amine system.\n- The specific sizing of equipment, especially the absorber and regenerator, will depend on detailed flue gas flow rates, CO2 concentration, and target capture efficiency, which are currently TBD.\n- Energy integration, particularly the lean/rich heat exchanger (E-102), is critical for reducing the high energy demand associated with MEA regeneration. Further optimization through heat integration networks could be explored.\n- Continuous monitoring of amine degradation products and implementing an amine reclaimer (e.g., as part of the make-up system via P-103) is essential for long-term operational stability and corrosion prevention.\n- The CO2 Compressor (C-103) and Dryer (D-101) are considered final polishing units, and their specific design depends heavily on the final CO2 product specifications (pressure, purity, dryness) which are TBD.",

                |\n\n## Notes\n- **General Mass Balance:** Total mass in (~100000 kg/h Flue Gas, ~60000 kg/h Lean MEA, ~15000 kg/h Steam, ~27000 kg/h Cooling Water, ~700 kg/h Reagents) approximately balances total mass out (~80000 kg/h treated flue gas, ~2200 kg/h CO2, ~15000 kg/h condensate, ~27000 kg/h cooling water, ~300 kg/h SOx effluent, ~1000 kg/h particulates, ~500 kg/h MEA/Water loss). Specific minor adjustments may be needed on a fine-tuned P&ID.\n- **Stream 1001 (Flue Gas Inlet):** Assumed a typical flue gas composition from a coal-fired power plant (high CO2, N2, O2, some water and trace SOx/particulates) as a representative \"various burner type\" to establish a baseline. Flow rate is a reasonable estimate for a medium-scale industrial source.\n- **Stream 1002 (Pressurized Flue Gas):** G-101 (fan) increases pressure slightly to overcome downstream pressure drops. Temperature rise due to compression is negligible for a fan.\n- **Stream 1003 (Cooled Flue Gas):** Flue gas cooled via E-101 to 40\u00b0C. Assumed significant water condensation due to cooling below dew point. This water is included in the mass flow reduction from 1002, with ~2000 kg/h liquid removal in E-101.\n- **Stream 1004 (Particulate-Free Flue Gas):** F-101 removes 99% of particulates. A slight pressure drop is assumed.\n- **Stream 1005 (SOx-Free Flue Gas):** R-101 removes ~99% of SOx using SOx Scrubber Reagents (Stream 1028). A small portion of water vapor may be added due to the wet scrubber, but this is minor compared to the total flow. The trace notation for SOx signifies <10 ppm.\n- **Stream 1006 (Treated Flue Gas (Vent)):** This stream leaves the absorber with ~96-98% of CO2 removed, resulting in a low CO2 concentration. A slight increase in temperature from the absorber is due to heat of absorption. Mass flow consists primarily of N2, O2, and reduced H2O, plus trace CO2 and MEA vapor.\n- **Streams 1007 (Lean MEA Inlet) & 1008 (Rich MEA Outlet):** MEA concentration is assumed to be 15wt% due to its corrosion properties and optimal CO2 loading. Flow rates are estimated to give a reasonable working capacity for CO2 absorption (assuming 0.3-0.5 mol CO2/mol MEA loading change). The MEA component in the key components represents the active MEA, not the total solution. 1008 is slightly warmer due to heat of absorption.\n- **Streams 1009 (Rich MEA to HX) & 1010 (Heated Rich MEA):** P-101 increases the pressure of the rich MEA for processing in the regenerator loop. E-102 heats the rich MEA from 55\u00b0C to 105\u00b0C, recovering heat from hot lean MEA.\n- **Stream 1011 (Lean MEA Outlet):** This stream is the regenerated lean MEA, cooled from 115\u00b0C to 45\u00b0C in E-102 before being pumped back to the absorber. CO2 content is reduced significantly (from 20 wt% to 5 wt% CO2 in solution).\n- **Stream 1012 (Regenerated CO2 + Steam) & 1018 (Reboiled Vapors):** High CO2 and H2O content, as the regenerator strives to strip CO2 and some water vapor from the MEA.\n- **Stream 1013 (Condensed Water) & 1019 (Water Recycle):** Water condensed from the regenerator overhead (E-104), largely pure. Assumed that all condensed water is recycled to C-102.\n- **Stream 1014 (Concentrated CO2):** This stream is predominantly CO2 with some water vapor and negligible MEA. Temperature is low after regeneration condenser.\n- **Stream 1015 (Steam Inlet) & 1016 (Condensate Return):** Saturated steam at 9 barg (approx. 180\u00b0C) provides heat to the reboiler. Condensate returns at a slightly lower pressure.\n- **Stream 1017 (Bottoms Reboiler Duty):** This stream is lean MEA from the bottom of the regenerator, sent to the reboiler to be heated (mass flow here is the circulation rate through the reboiler, much higher than the lean MEA outlet flow).\n- **Stream 1020 (Make-up MEA/Water) & 1021 (Make-up/Reclaimer Feed):** Estimated at 500 kg/h for a plant of this size to account for MEA degradation and water losses. The composition is primarily MEA (~90%) and water (~10%) for simple make-up. Actual proportions depend on reclamation needs.\n- **Stream 1022 (Compressed CO2) & 1023 (Dried CO2 Product):** C-103 compresses the relatively low-pressure CO2 to a higher pressure. D-101 removes remaining moisture to meet product specifications. Purity increases slightly.\n- **Cooling Water Streams (1024, 1025, 1026, 1027):** Cooling water mass flows assume a 10\u00b0C temperature rise across the heat exchangers. Standard city or process water.\n- **SOx Scrubber Streams (1028, 1029):** Assumed an alkaline solution (e.g., 10wt% NaOH) for SOx removal. The effluent (1029) contains reacted SO2 salts and water. Mass flow is dependent on SOx content in flue gas and reagent concentration.\n- **Stream 1030 (Particulate Waste):** Mass flow estimated based on ~1% of flue gas mass flow being particulates.\n\n- **Overall Component Balances:**\n    - **N2, O2, Other Gases:** Primarily enter with 1001 and exit with 1006. Minimal absorption.\n    - **CO2:** Enters with 1001, predominantly captured and exits with 1023. ~96% capture assumed. Small amount exits with 1006.\n    - **H2O:** Enters with 1001, 1007, 1015, 1020, 1028. Exits with 1006, 1016, 1025, 1027, 1029, 1023 (minor). Internal recycle via 1019.\n    - **MEA:** Enters with 1007, 1020. Circulates within the amine loop (1007, 1008, 1009, 1010, 1011, 1017). Trace losses to 1006, 1012, 1018. Loss compensated by 1020.\n    - **SOx:** Enters with 1001, largely removed by 1028 in R-101, exits with 1029. Trace amounts may exit with 1006 if removal is incomplete.\n    - **Particulates:** Enters with 1001. Mostly removed by F-101 and exit as 1030. Trace amounts may remain in 1004, 1005, 1006.\n- **Assumed Flue Gas Composition (1001):** Representing a typical coal-fired power plant flue gas for this estimation. Actual values would vary widely for \"various burner types\" and a more detailed design would need specific feed cases.\n- **CO2 Capture Efficiency:** Estimated at ~96%.\n- **Pressure Drop:** Assumed typical pressure drops across equipment (e.g., F-101, R-101, C-101, E-101).\n- **Temperatures:** Based on typical operating ranges for MEA absorption/regeneration.\n- **Thermodynamic properties & Phase:** Ideal gas behavior for flue gas, liquid for amine solutions, steam tables for water/steam. Flash calculations for E-101 and E-104 overhead.\n- **Reboiler/Condenser Duties:** Sizing of E-103 and E-104 heavily impacts energy balance and would require detailed calculations based on heat of reaction for CO2 absorption/desorption and latent heats of vaporization.

                |\n\n## Notes\n- **General Mass Balance:** Total mass in (~100000 kg/h Flue Gas, ~60000 kg/h Lean MEA, ~15000 kg/h Steam, ~27000 kg/h Cooling Water, ~700 kg/h Reagents) approximately balances total mass out (~80000 kg/h treated flue gas, ~2200 kg/h CO2, ~15000 kg/h condensate, ~27000 kg/h cooling water, ~300 kg/h SOx effluent, ~1000 kg/h particulates, ~500 kg/h MEA/Water loss). Specific minor adjustments may be needed on a fine-tuned P&ID.\n- **Stream 1001 (Flue Gas Inlet):** Assumed a typical flue gas composition from a coal-fired power plant (high CO2, N2, O2, some water and trace SOx/particulates) as a representative \"various burner type\" to establish a baseline. Flow rate is a reasonable estimate for a medium-scale industrial source.\n- **Stream 1002 (Pressurized Flue Gas):** G-101 (fan) increases pressure slightly to overcome downstream pressure drops. Temperature rise due to compression is negligible for a fan.\n- **Stream 1003 (Cooled Flue Gas):** Flue gas cooled via E-101 to 40\u00b0C. Assumed significant water condensation due to cooling below dew point. This water is included in the mass flow reduction from 1002, with ~2000 kg/h liquid removal in E-101.\n- **Stream 1004 (Particulate-Free Flue Gas):** F-101 removes 99% of particulates. A slight pressure drop is assumed.\n- **Stream 1005 (SOx-Free Flue Gas):** R-101 removes ~99% of SOx using SOx Scrubber Reagents (Stream 1028). A small portion of water vapor may be added due to the wet scrubber, but this is minor compared to the total flow. The trace notation for SOx signifies <10 ppm.\n- **Stream 1006 (Treated Flue Gas (Vent)):** This stream leaves the absorber with ~96-98% of CO2 removed, resulting in a low CO2 concentration. A slight increase in temperature from the absorber is due to heat of absorption. Mass flow consists primarily of N2, O2, and reduced H2O, plus trace CO2 and MEA vapor.\n- **Streams 1007 (Lean MEA Inlet) & 1008 (Rich MEA Outlet):** MEA concentration is assumed to be 15wt% due to its corrosion properties and optimal CO2 loading. Flow rates are estimated to give a reasonable working capacity for CO2 absorption (assuming 0.3-0.5 mol CO2/mol MEA loading change). The MEA component in the key components represents the active MEA, not the total solution. 1008 is slightly warmer due to heat of absorption.\n- **Streams 1009 (Rich MEA to HX) & 1010 (Heated Rich MEA):** P-101 increases the pressure of the rich MEA for processing in the regenerator loop. E-102 heats the rich MEA from 55\u00b0C to 105\u00b0C, recovering heat from hot lean MEA.\n- **Stream 1011 (Lean MEA Outlet):** This stream is the regenerated lean MEA, cooled from 115\u00b0C to 45\u00b0C in E-102 before being pumped back to the absorber. CO2 content is reduced significantly (from 20 wt% to 5 wt% CO2 in solution).\n- **Stream 1012 (Regenerated CO2 + Steam) & 1018 (Reboiled Vapors):** High CO2 and H2O content, as the regenerator strives to strip CO2 and some water vapor from the MEA.\n- **Stream 1013 (Condensed Water) & 1019 (Water Recycle):** Water condensed from the regenerator overhead (E-104), largely pure. Assumed that all condensed water is recycled to C-102.\n- **Stream 1014 (Concentrated CO2):** This stream is predominantly CO2 with some water vapor and negligible MEA. Temperature is low after regeneration condenser.\n- **Stream 1015 (Steam Inlet) & 1016 (Condensate Return):** Saturated steam at 9 barg (approx. 180\u00b0C) provides heat to the reboiler. Condensate returns at a slightly lower pressure.\n- **Stream 1017 (Bottoms Reboiler Duty):** This stream is lean MEA from the bottom of the regenerator, sent to the reboiler to be heated (mass flow here is the circulation rate through the reboiler, much higher than the lean MEA outlet flow).\n- **Stream 1020 (Make-up MEA/Water) & 1021 (Make-up/Reclaimer Feed):** Estimated at 500 kg/h for a plant of this size to account for MEA degradation and water losses. The composition is primarily MEA (~90%) and water (~10%) for simple make-up. Actual proportions depend on reclamation needs.\n- **Stream 1022 (Compressed CO2) & 1023 (Dried CO2 Product):** C-103 compresses the relatively low-pressure CO2 to a higher pressure. D-101 removes remaining moisture to meet product specifications. Purity increases slightly.\n- **Cooling Water Streams (1024, 1025, 1026, 1027):** Cooling water mass flows assume a 10\u00b0C temperature rise across the heat exchangers. Standard city or process water.\n- **SOx Scrubber Streams (1028, 1029):** Assumed an alkaline solution (e.g., 10wt% NaOH) for SOx removal. The effluent (1029) contains reacted SO2 salts and water. Mass flow is dependent on SOx content in flue gas and reagent concentration.\n- **Stream 1030 (Particulate Waste):** Mass flow estimated based on ~1% of flue gas mass flow being particulates.\n\n- **Overall Component Balances:**\n    - **N2, O2, Other Gases:** Primarily enter with 1001 and exit with 1006. Minimal absorption.\n    - **CO2:** Enters with 1001, predominantly captured and exits with 1023. ~96% capture assumed. Small amount exits with 1006.\n    - **H2O:** Enters with 1001, 1007, 1015, 1020, 1028. Exits with 1006, 1016, 1025, 1027, 1029, 1023 (minor). Internal recycle via 1019.\n    - **MEA:** Enters with 1007, 1020. Circulates within the amine loop (1007, 1008, 1009, 1010, 1011, 1017). Trace losses to 1006, 1012, 1018. Loss compensated by 1020.\n    - **SOx:** Enters with 1001, largely removed by 1028 in R-101, exits with 1029. Trace amounts may exit with 1006 if removal is incomplete.\n    - **Particulates:** Enters with 1001. Mostly removed by F-101 and exit as 1030. Trace amounts may remain in 1004, 1005, 1006.\n- **Assumed Flue Gas Composition (1001):** Representing a typical coal-fired power plant flue gas for this estimation. Actual values would vary widely for \"various burner types\" and a more detailed design would need specific feed cases.\n- **CO2 Capture Efficiency:** Estimated at ~96%.\n- **Pressure Drop:** Assumed typical pressure drops across equipment (e.g., F-101, R-101, C-101, E-101).\n- **Temperatures:** Based on typical operating ranges for MEA absorption/regeneration.\n- **Thermodynamic properties & Phase:** Ideal gas behavior for flue gas, liquid for amine solutions, steam tables for water/steam. Flash calculations for E-101 and E-104 overhead.\n- **Reboiler/Condenser Duties:** Sizing of E-103 and E-104 heavily impacts energy balance and would require detailed calculations based on heat of reaction for CO2 absorption/desorption and latent heats of vaporization. The steam flow rate (15000 kg/h) for 2200 kg/h CO2 captured implies a steam consumption of ~6.8 kg steam/kg CO2, which is a common value for MEA.",
