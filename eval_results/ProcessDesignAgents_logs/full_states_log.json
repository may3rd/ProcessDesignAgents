The key innovation lies in the meticulous design of the gas separation and purification train to efficiently collect the co-produced hydrogen as 'blue hydrogen', implying CO2 capture if any, though the primary reaction (CH4 -> C + 2H2) itself is carbon neutral for H2 production. The LNG feedstock is vaporized and preheated before entering the reactor, where methane decomposes over a supported catalyst to form MWCNTs and hydrogen. Strict temperature control is crucial for MWCNT quality and selectivity.",

Methane decomposes to MWCNTs and hydrogen in a riser or dense-phase reactor section over a catalyst. Catalyst deactivation due to carbon deposition (MWCNT formation) is inherent. The spent catalyst, now laden with MWCNTs, is continuously withdrawn and separated. A portion of the catalyst can be regenerated (decoked) in a separate regenerator by burning off excess carbon if not all carbon is desired as product, or by a different in-situ method. The MWCNTs are separated from the catalyst particles. This design allows for continuous operation and potentially better temperature control at scale.",

The methane is preheated to reaction temperature before entering a fluidized bed reactor where it decomposes into Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNT) and hydrogen. The reactor effluent, a mixture of MWCNTs, hydrogen, and unreacted methane, then passes through primary cyclones and a bag filter to separate the MWCNTs. The collected MWCNTs are sent for collection and packaging. The remaining gas stream, primarily hydrogen and methane, is quenched, cooled, and compressed before entering a Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) or Membrane separation unit. Here, high-purity 'blue hydrogen' is separated and sent to storage. Unreacted methane can be recycled to the preheater for process optimization."
