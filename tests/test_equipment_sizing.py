    "selected_concept_details": "## Concept Summary\n- Name: Modular Amine Scrubbing (MEA/PZ)\n- Intent: Capture CO2 from variable flue gas sources using chemical absorption to meet a 99.5% purity target.\n- Feasibility Score (from review): 8\n\n## Process Narrative\nThe process begins with the raw flue gas feed, which is highly variable in composition and temperature. Due to the high sensitivity of the amine solvent, the flue gas must first enter a robust Flue Gas Pre-treatment section (likely a quench and/or wet scrubber) to remove particulates, $SO_x$, $NO_x$, and cool the stream to the optimal absorption temperature (TBD, typically 40-60\u00b0C). The cleaned, cooled flue gas then enters the bottom of the Amine Absorber Column. Lean amine solvent (MEA or PZ-enhanced) flows counter-currently from the top, chemically reacting with and absorbing the $CO_2$. The cleaned flue gas (vent gas) exits the top of the absorber.\n\nThe $CO_2$-rich solvent (rich amine) exits the bottom of the absorber, passes through a Lean/Rich Heat Exchanger to recover heat, and is then pumped to the Amine Stripper/Regenerator Column. Here, low-pressure steam supplied by the Reboiler heats the solvent, reversing the chemical reaction and releasing high-purity $CO_2$. The steam/CO2 mixture is cooled in the Condenser to separate water, which is returned to the column. The resulting high-purity $CO_2$ stream is then sent to the $CO_2$ Compressor/Drying Unit for final purification and pressurization for transport or sequestration. The regenerated (lean) amine solvent is cooled in the Lean/Rich Heat Exchanger and returned to the Absorber, completing the solvent loop.\n\n## Major Equipment & Roles\n| Equipment | Function | Critical Operating Notes |\n|---|---|---|\n| Flue Gas Pre-treatment (Scrubber/Quench) | Remove contaminants ($SO_x$, particulates) and cool the flue gas. | Must achieve contaminant levels below 5 ppmv to prevent irreversible solvent degradation. Requires continuous water makeup. |\n| Amine Absorber Column | Contact flue gas with lean amine to chemically absorb $CO_2$. | Maintain optimal temperature (TBD) and solvent flow rate (L/G ratio) for maximum capture efficiency. |\n| Amine Stripper/Regenerator Column | Heat rich amine to release $CO_2$ and regenerate the solvent. | Requires a consistent supply of low-pressure steam (TBD pressure) to the Reboiler. Pressure control is critical for purity. |\n| Lean/Rich Heat Exchanger | Recover thermal energy from hot lean amine to pre-heat rich amine. | Maximize heat recovery to minimize steam consumption in the Reboiler (critical for OPEX). |\n| Reboiler | Supply thermal energy (steam) to the Stripper for solvent regeneration. | Design must handle potential fouling from degraded solvent. High thermal efficiency required. |\n| CO2 Compressor/Drying Unit | Pressurize and dry the captured $CO_2$ to meet transport/sequestration specifications. | Multi-stage compression with intercoolers. Must achieve a water content suitable for 99.5% purity and pipeline specifications. |\n\n## Operating Envelope\n- Design capacity: TBD (Must be defined by required CO2 removal rate, likely expressed in tonnes/day).\n- Key pressure levels: Absorber operates near atmospheric pressure (TBD, likely 1.01-1.1 bara). Stripper operates at elevated pressure (TBD, likely 1.5-3.0 bara) to facilitate $CO_2$ compression.\n- Key temperature levels: Absorber inlet (flue gas) TBD (likely 40-60\u00b0C). Stripper Reboiler temperature TBD (likely 110-120\u00b0C).\n- Special utilities / additives: Low-pressure steam (primary utility for regeneration), cooling water (for Condenser and intercoolers), process water (for pre-treatment quench), Amine solvent (MEA or PZ-enhanced) makeup.\n\n## Risks & Safeguards\n| Process Risk | Mitigation / Safeguard |\n|---|---|\n| Flue gas contamination causes rapid solvent degradation and corrosion. | Install continuous online analyzers for $SO_x$/particulates post-pre-treatment with automatic diversion/shutdown if limits are exceeded. Specify corrosion-resistant metallurgy (e.g., stainless steel) in high-temperature/high-concentration sections. |\n| High steam consumption leads to excessive operating costs (OPEX). | Implement advanced control strategies (e.g., dynamic solvent flow adjustment) to minimize the specific reboiler duty (GJ/tonne CO2). Use PZ-enhanced solvent to lower the heat of reaction. |\n| Solvent loss via evaporation or entrainment (environmental/safety risk). | Install a solvent wash section (water wash) at the top of the Absorber. Implement continuous solvent level and concentration monitoring with automated makeup and strict process control on temperature. |\n| Foaming in Absorber/Stripper reduces efficiency. | Install automated anti-foam injection system triggered by differential pressure monitoring across the column packing. |\n\n## Data Gaps & Assumptions\n- The required CO2 recovery rate (e.g., 90%) is **TBD**. This is necessary to size the Absorber and determine solvent circulation rate.\n- Detailed characterization of the flue gas feed (min/max flow, $CO_2$ concentration, temperature, and worst-case $SO_x$/$NO_x$ levels) is **TBD**. This directly impacts the pre-treatment design.\n- The specific solvent (MEA concentration vs. PZ-enhanced) is **TBD**; selection will depend on the final OPEX/CAPEX trade-off study.\n- The required pressure and dryness specification for the final captured $CO_2$ product (for transport/sequestration) is **TBD**.\n- Steam availability pressure and cost are **TBD**, which is critical for the economic evaluation.",
    "design_basis": "# Preliminary Process Basis of Design (BoD)\n\n## 1. Project Overview and Problem Statement\nThis document provides the preliminary basis for the design of a new modular Carbon Capture Unit (CCU) utilizing Amine Scrubbing technology.

Preliminary Utility Summary\n*   **Primary Energy Utility (Heat):** Low-Pressure (LP) Steam (3-5 barg) required for the Stripper Reboiler. This is the largest utility consumer.\n*   **Cooling Utility:** Cooling Water (CW) required for the Absorber intercoolers, Stripper Condenser, and CO2 Compressor intercoolers.\n*   **Electrical Power:** Required for all pumps (Amine, Water), Blowers (if needed), and the multi-stage CO2 Compressor train.\n*   **Process Water:** Required for Flue Gas Quench/Scrubber and Amine Solvent Wash section makeup. Water quality must be suitable for steam generation and process use.\n*   **Chemicals:** Amine Solvent (MEA or PZ-enhanced) makeup, Anti-foam agents, Corrosion Inhibitors, and Pre-treatment scrubber chemicals (e.g., caustic soda if required).\n\n## 6. Environmental and Regulatory Criteria\n*   **Vent Gas Emissions:** The cleaned flue gas (vent gas) exiting the Absorber must meet local environmental regulations for CO2 reduction (defined by the assumed 90% recovery rate) and must ensure minimal Amine carryover (e.g., <1 ppmv Amine).\n*   **Wastewater:** Wastewater from the Flue Gas Pre-treatment Scrubber and the Amine reclamation unit (if included) must be treated to remove heavy metals, degraded amine products, and particulates before discharge or recycling.\n*   **Noise:** Due to the modular nature and potential urban proximity, the CO2 Compressor and vacuum systems must be acoustically insulated to meet site-specific noise limits.\n*   **Safety (Process Hazards):** The system must adhere to standard chemical process safety practices (HAZOP) regarding handling flammable/toxic Amine solvents and high-pressure CO2 streams.\n\n## 7. Process Selection Rationale (High-Level)\nThe selection of Modular Amine Scrubbing (MEA/PZ) is based on its proven ability to achieve high CO2 purity (99.5%) from dilute flue gas streams, a critical requirement. While the high energy demand (steam) is a drawback, the technology offers the highest operational flexibility in handling variable CO2 concentrations and is commercially mature, which reduces project risk for a modular, multi-source application. The modular design will focus heavily on optimizing the Lean/Rich Heat Exchanger and utilizing advanced solvents (PZ-enhanced) to minimize the specific reboiler duty (GJ/tonne CO2).\n\n## 8. Preliminary Material of Construction (MoC) Basis\n*   **Flue Gas Pre-treatment:** Fiberglass Reinforced Plastic (FRP) or specialized alloys (e.g., 316L SS) required due to low pH and high chloride/SOx content in the scrubber/quench environment.\n*   **Absorber Column:** Carbon Steel (CS) with internal stainless steel (304L/316L) cladding or lining, particularly at the solvent inlet and high-velocity zones.\n*   **Stripper Column/Reboiler:** Stainless Steel (316L SS) is mandatory due to the high temperature (110-120\u00b0C) and high concentration of corrosive, regenerated amine solvent.\n*   **CO2 Compressor/Drying:** Carbon Steel (CS) for initial stages; Stainless Steel (304L) for final stages and drying unit to ensure product purity and corrosion resistance from trace moisture.",

The cleaned, cooled gas (1002) feeds the bottom of the **Amine Absorber (C-101)**. Lean amine solvent (2003) flows counter-currently, absorbing CO2. The cleaned vent gas (3001) exits the top.\n\nThe CO2-loaded rich amine (1003) is pumped (P-101) and pre-heated in the **Lean/Rich Heat Exchanger (E-101)** (1005) before entering the **Amine Stripper (C-201)**. Low-Pressure Steam (4001) supplies heat via the **Reboiler (E-201)**, stripping the CO2. The hot, regenerated lean amine (2001) is cooled in E-101 (2002) and pumped (P-201) back to the Absorber (2003).\n\nThe Stripper overhead vapor (1006) is condensed (E-202), and water is separated in the **Reflux Drum (V-201)**, with the condensate returned (4005) to C-201. The wet CO2 product (1007) is compressed in the **Compressor Train (K-301)** and dried in the **Drying Unit (D-301)** to meet the final purity and water specification (1008).\n\n## Notes\n- **Modularity:** The process is conceptually divided into three main skids: 1) Pre-treatment/Quench (V-101 and associated pumps/filters), 2) Absorption/Regeneration Loop (C-101, C-201, E-101, E-201, pumps), and 3) CO2 Compression/Drying (K-301, D-301, V-201).\n- **Advanced Integration:** E-101 (Lean/Rich Heat Exchanger) is the single most critical component for OPEX. A high-efficiency plate-and-frame or spiral heat exchanger is recommended to maximize heat recovery and minimize steam consumption (4001).\n- **Instrumentation:** Continuous online analyzers for $SO_x$ and particulates must be installed on stream 1002 (Cleaned Flue Gas) to ensure contaminant levels are below 5 ppmv. This data should trigger an automated shutdown or bypass if limits are exceeded, protecting the amine inventory.\n- **Safety:** The CO2 Compressor (K-301) requires robust intercooling and moisture removal to prevent hydrate formation and corrosion. The final drying unit (D-301) is mandatory to meet the 50 ppmv H2O requirement for pipeline safety.\n- **Solvent Management:** An Amine Reclamation Unit (not shown, but required for commercial operation) should be considered downstream of P-201 to continuously purify a small slipstream of the circulating amine, removing heat-stable salts and degradation products.",

Final CAPEX/OPEX will be sensitive to the final capacity required by the project.\n- The design basis assumes 90% CO2 recovery; any change to this target will significantly impact solvent circulation, equipment sizing, and utility consumption.\n- The regeneration duty and utility requirements for the CO2 Drying Unit (D-301) are listed as 'TBD' and must be defined to finalize utility balances and operating costs.\n- The HAZOP recommends 100% redundant pumps for solvent circulation (P-101, P-201); this must be incorporated into the final equipment list and CAPEX estimate.\n- A detailed solvent management plan, including the design basis for an Amine Reclamation unit, is required to manage long-term solvent degradation and waste streams (e.g., stream 3002)."

You are a **Lead Equipment Sizing Engineer** responsible for finalizing equipment specifications using automated sizing tools.

**Context:**

  * You have access to sizing calculations tools (heat exchangers, pumps, vessels, compressors).
  * Your task is to use these tools to fill in the missing values in the final equipment specification JSON, adding engineering judgment and filling gaps where tools could not be applied.
  * I want the equipment list with the upadte sizing_parameter of the equipment provided from user.
  
**Tool Available:** `size_heat_exchanger_basic`, `size_pump_basic`, `size_vessel_basic`, `size_compressor_basic`.

**Instructions:**

  1. **Use Sizing Tool:** to calculate the equipment specification values.
  
  2. **Populate Sizing Parameters:** Use tool results to fill the `sizing_parameters` array. For example:
     - Heat Exchanger: ["Area: <area_m2> m²", "LMTD: <lmtd_C> °C", "U: <U_design_W_m2K> W/m²·K"]
     - Pump: ["Flow: <flow_m3_hr> m³/h", "Head: <total_head_m> m", "Power: <motor_rating_kW> kW"]
     - Vessel: ["Diameter: <diameter_mm> mm", "Length: <length_mm> mm", "Thickness: <shell_thickness_mm> mm"]
     - Compressor: ["Stages: <number_of_stages>", "Power: <driver_rating_kW> kW", "Discharge Temp: <discharge_temperature_C> °C"]
  
  3. **Update Duty/Load Field:** Replace placeholder values with calculated duties (e.g., "21.7 MW" for heat exchanger, "45 kW" for pump motor).
  
  4. **Document in Notes:** Reference the tool used and key assumptions. Example: "Sized using heat_exchanger_sizing tool with LMTD method. U-value estimated at 850 W/m²·K for hydrocarbon/water service."
  
  5. **Handle Missing Tool Results:** For equipment without tool results (columns, special equipment), use engineering judgment and the stream data to provide reasonable estimates or mark as "TBD".
  
  6. **Update Assumptions:** Add any new global assumptions to `metadata.assumptions`, such as "All pump efficiencies assumed at 75% unless specified."

  7. **Maintain JSON Structure:** Output ONLY a valid JSON object matching the equipment template schema. Do NOT use code fences.
  
  8. **Update the Equipment List:** Use the results from the tool to update the equipment list.

```

**Critical Rules:**

  - All numeric values must have units
  - Round to appropriate precision (areas to 0.1 m², power to nearest kW)
  - Reference tool usage in notes for traceability
  - If tool result contains "error", note the issue and provide manual estimate or "TBD"
  - **Output ONLY the final equipment list JSON object (no code fences, no additional text).**
