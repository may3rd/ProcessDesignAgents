    "selected_concept_details": "## Concept Summary\n- Name: Modular Amine Scrubbing (MEA/PZ)\n- Intent: Capture CO2 from variable flue gas sources using chemical absorption to meet a 99.5% purity target.\n- Feasibility Score (from review): 8\n\n## Process Narrative\nThe process begins with the raw flue gas feed, which is highly variable in composition and temperature. Due to the high sensitivity of the amine solvent, the flue gas must first enter a robust Flue Gas Pre-treatment section (likely a quench and/or wet scrubber) to remove particulates, $SO_x$, $NO_x$, and cool the stream to the optimal absorption temperature (TBD, typically 40-60\u00b0C). The cleaned, cooled flue gas then enters the bottom of the Amine Absorber Column. Lean amine solvent (MEA or PZ-enhanced) flows counter-currently from the top, chemically reacting with and absorbing the $CO_2$. The cleaned flue gas (vent gas) exits the top of the absorber.\n\nThe $CO_2$-rich solvent (rich amine) exits the bottom of the absorber, passes through a Lean/Rich Heat Exchanger to recover heat, and is then pumped to the Amine Stripper/Regenerator Column. Here, low-pressure steam supplied by the Reboiler heats the solvent, reversing the chemical reaction and releasing high-purity $CO_2$. The steam/CO2 mixture is cooled in the Condenser to separate water, which is returned to the column. The resulting high-purity $CO_2$ stream is then sent to the $CO_2$ Compressor/Drying Unit for final purification and pressurization for transport or sequestration. The regenerated (lean) amine solvent is cooled in the Lean/Rich Heat Exchanger and returned to the Absorber, completing the solvent loop.\n\n## Major Equipment & Roles\n| Equipment | Function | Critical Operating Notes |\n|---|---|---|\n| Flue Gas Pre-treatment (Scrubber/Quench) | Remove contaminants ($SO_x$, particulates) and cool the flue gas. | Must achieve contaminant levels below 5 ppmv to prevent irreversible solvent degradation. Requires continuous water makeup. |\n| Amine Absorber Column | Contact flue gas with lean amine to chemically absorb $CO_2$. | Maintain optimal temperature (TBD) and solvent flow rate (L/G ratio) for maximum capture efficiency. |\n| Amine Stripper/Regenerator Column | Heat rich amine to release $CO_2$ and regenerate the solvent. | Requires a consistent supply of low-pressure steam (TBD pressure) to the Reboiler. Pressure control is critical for purity. |\n| Lean/Rich Heat Exchanger | Recover thermal energy from hot lean amine to pre-heat rich amine. | Maximize heat recovery to minimize steam consumption in the Reboiler (critical for OPEX). |\n| Reboiler | Supply thermal energy (steam) to the Stripper for solvent regeneration. | Design must handle potential fouling from degraded solvent. High thermal efficiency required. |\n| CO2 Compressor/Drying Unit | Pressurize and dry the captured $CO_2$ to meet transport/sequestration specifications. | Multi-stage compression with intercoolers. Must achieve a water content suitable for 99.5% purity and pipeline specifications. |\n\n## Operating Envelope\n- Design capacity: TBD (Must be defined by required CO2 removal rate, likely expressed in tonnes/day).\n- Key pressure levels: Absorber operates near atmospheric pressure (TBD, likely 1.01-1.1 bara). Stripper operates at elevated pressure (TBD, likely 1.5-3.0 bara) to facilitate $CO_2$ compression.\n- Key temperature levels: Absorber inlet (flue gas) TBD (likely 40-60\u00b0C). Stripper Reboiler temperature TBD (likely 110-120\u00b0C).\n- Special utilities / additives: Low-pressure steam (primary utility for regeneration), cooling water (for Condenser and intercoolers), process water (for pre-treatment quench), Amine solvent (MEA or PZ-enhanced) makeup.\n\n## Risks & Safeguards\n| Process Risk | Mitigation / Safeguard |\n|---|---|\n| Flue gas contamination causes rapid solvent degradation and corrosion. | Install continuous online analyzers for $SO_x$/particulates post-pre-treatment with automatic diversion/shutdown if limits are exceeded. Specify corrosion-resistant metallurgy (e.g., stainless steel) in high-temperature/high-concentration sections. |\n| High steam consumption leads to excessive operating costs (OPEX). | Implement advanced control strategies (e.g., dynamic solvent flow adjustment) to minimize the specific reboiler duty (GJ/tonne CO2). Use PZ-enhanced solvent to lower the heat of reaction. |\n| Solvent loss via evaporation or entrainment (environmental/safety risk). | Install a solvent wash section (water wash) at the top of the Absorber. Implement continuous solvent level and concentration monitoring with automated makeup and strict process control on temperature. |\n| Foaming in Absorber/Stripper reduces efficiency. | Install automated anti-foam injection system triggered by differential pressure monitoring across the column packing. |\n\n## Data Gaps & Assumptions\n- The required CO2 recovery rate (e.g., 90%) is **TBD**. This is necessary to size the Absorber and determine solvent circulation rate.\n- Detailed characterization of the flue gas feed (min/max flow, $CO_2$ concentration, temperature, and worst-case $SO_x$/$NO_x$ levels) is **TBD**. This directly impacts the pre-treatment design.\n- The specific solvent (MEA concentration vs. PZ-enhanced) is **TBD**; selection will depend on the final OPEX/CAPEX trade-off study.\n- The required pressure and dryness specification for the final captured $CO_2$ product (for transport/sequestration) is **TBD**.\n- Steam availability pressure and cost are **TBD**, which is critical for the economic evaluation.",
    "design_basis": "# Preliminary Process Basis of Design (BoD)\n\n## 1. Project Overview and Problem Statement\nThis document provides the preliminary basis for the design of a new modular Carbon Capture Unit (CCU) utilizing Amine Scrubbing technology.

Preliminary Utility Summary\n*   **Primary Energy Utility (Heat):** Low-Pressure (LP) Steam (3-5 barg) required for the Stripper Reboiler. This is the largest utility consumer.\n*   **Cooling Utility:** Cooling Water (CW) required for the Absorber intercoolers, Stripper Condenser, and CO2 Compressor intercoolers.\n*   **Electrical Power:** Required for all pumps (Amine, Water), Blowers (if needed), and the multi-stage CO2 Compressor train.\n*   **Process Water:** Required for Flue Gas Quench/Scrubber and Amine Solvent Wash section makeup. Water quality must be suitable for steam generation and process use.\n*   **Chemicals:** Amine Solvent (MEA or PZ-enhanced) makeup, Anti-foam agents, Corrosion Inhibitors, and Pre-treatment scrubber chemicals (e.g., caustic soda if required).\n\n## 6. Environmental and Regulatory Criteria\n*   **Vent Gas Emissions:** The cleaned flue gas (vent gas) exiting the Absorber must meet local environmental regulations for CO2 reduction (defined by the assumed 90% recovery rate) and must ensure minimal Amine carryover (e.g., <1 ppmv Amine).\n*   **Wastewater:** Wastewater from the Flue Gas Pre-treatment Scrubber and the Amine reclamation unit (if included) must be treated to remove heavy metals, degraded amine products, and particulates before discharge or recycling.\n*   **Noise:** Due to the modular nature and potential urban proximity, the CO2 Compressor and vacuum systems must be acoustically insulated to meet site-specific noise limits.\n*   **Safety (Process Hazards):** The system must adhere to standard chemical process safety practices (HAZOP) regarding handling flammable/toxic Amine solvents and high-pressure CO2 streams.\n\n## 7. Process Selection Rationale (High-Level)\nThe selection of Modular Amine Scrubbing (MEA/PZ) is based on its proven ability to achieve high CO2 purity (99.5%) from dilute flue gas streams, a critical requirement. While the high energy demand (steam) is a drawback, the technology offers the highest operational flexibility in handling variable CO2 concentrations and is commercially mature, which reduces project risk for a modular, multi-source application. The modular design will focus heavily on optimizing the Lean/Rich Heat Exchanger and utilizing advanced solvents (PZ-enhanced) to minimize the specific reboiler duty (GJ/tonne CO2).\n\n## 8. Preliminary Material of Construction (MoC) Basis\n*   **Flue Gas Pre-treatment:** Fiberglass Reinforced Plastic (FRP) or specialized alloys (e.g., 316L SS) required due to low pH and high chloride/SOx content in the scrubber/quench environment.\n*   **Absorber Column:** Carbon Steel (CS) with internal stainless steel (304L/316L) cladding or lining, particularly at the solvent inlet and high-velocity zones.\n*   **Stripper Column/Reboiler:** Stainless Steel (316L SS) is mandatory due to the high temperature (110-120\u00b0C) and high concentration of corrosive, regenerated amine solvent.\n*   **CO2 Compressor/Drying:** Carbon Steel (CS) for initial stages; Stainless Steel (304L) for final stages and drying unit to ensure product purity and corrosion resistance from trace moisture.",

The cleaned, cooled gas (1002) feeds the bottom of the **Amine Absorber (C-101)**. Lean amine solvent (2003) flows counter-currently, absorbing CO2. The cleaned vent gas (3001) exits the top.\n\nThe CO2-loaded rich amine (1003) is pumped (P-101) and pre-heated in the **Lean/Rich Heat Exchanger (E-101)** (1005) before entering the **Amine Stripper (C-201)**. Low-Pressure Steam (4001) supplies heat via the **Reboiler (E-201)**, stripping the CO2. The hot, regenerated lean amine (2001) is cooled in E-101 (2002) and pumped (P-201) back to the Absorber (2003).\n\nThe Stripper overhead vapor (1006) is condensed (E-202), and water is separated in the **Reflux Drum (V-201)**, with the condensate returned (4005) to C-201. The wet CO2 product (1007) is compressed in the **Compressor Train (K-301)** and dried in the **Drying Unit (D-301)** to meet the final purity and water specification (1008).\n\n## Notes\n- **Modularity:** The process is conceptually divided into three main skids: 1) Pre-treatment/Quench (V-101 and associated pumps/filters), 2) Absorption/Regeneration Loop (C-101, C-201, E-101, E-201, pumps), and 3) CO2 Compression/Drying (K-301, D-301, V-201).\n- **Advanced Integration:** E-101 (Lean/Rich Heat Exchanger) is the single most critical component for OPEX. A high-efficiency plate-and-frame or spiral heat exchanger is recommended to maximize heat recovery and minimize steam consumption (4001).\n- **Instrumentation:** Continuous online analyzers for $SO_x$ and particulates must be installed on stream 1002 (Cleaned Flue Gas) to ensure contaminant levels are below 5 ppmv. This data should trigger an automated shutdown or bypass if limits are exceeded, protecting the amine inventory.\n- **Safety:** The CO2 Compressor (K-301) requires robust intercooling and moisture removal to prevent hydrate formation and corrosion. The final drying unit (D-301) is mandatory to meet the 50 ppmv H2O requirement for pipeline safety.\n- **Solvent Management:** An Amine Reclamation Unit (not shown, but required for commercial operation) should be considered downstream of P-201 to continuously purify a small slipstream of the circulating amine, removing heat-stable salts and degradation products.",

This hot stream flows through the shell side of the Fixed Tubesheet Shell-and-Tube Heat Exchanger (E-101). Simultaneously, the cooling utility fluid (assumed to be cooling water) is supplied from the plant utility header and flows through the tube side of E-101. Heat is transferred from the hot ethanol to the cooler utility fluid, reducing the ethanol temperature to the target of 40\u00b0C.\n\nThe cooled ethanol exits E-101 and passes through an Outlet Control Valve (CV-101) to regulate the downstream pressure and flow rate, ensuring stable operation of the entire cooling system and preventing thermal shock to downstream equipment. The utility fluid, now warmed, is returned to the plant's cooling water system for re-cooling. The simplicity of this design relies heavily on the utility fluid being chemically compatible and thermally stable enough to manage the required heat load without causing excessive fouling or thermal stress on the fixed tube bundle.\n\n## Major Equipment & Roles\n\n| Equipment | Function | Critical Operating Notes |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| P-101 Feed Pump | Provide necessary head to move the ethanol stream through the exchanger and control flow. | Must be sized based on the calculated duty and required pressure drop (TBD).

This is the single most critical input for sizing E-101.\n2.  **Process Pressure:** The required operating pressure for the ethanol stream is **TBD**. This dictates pump selection (P-101) and valve sizing (CV-101).\n3.  **Heat Duty ($Q$):** The required heat duty must be calculated using the specific heat capacity ($C_p$) of the 99.5% ethanol stream at the operating temperatures. The $C_p$ value is **TBD** and must be confirmed via thermodynamic property software or lab data.\n4.  **Fouling Factor:** The expected fouling resistance ($R_f$) for the ethanol stream is **TBD**.

Preliminary Utility Summary\n*   **Primary Utility:** Cooling Water (CW). Specifications (flow, temperature) are **TBD**.\n*   **Secondary Utility:** Electricity required for Feed Pump (P-101).\n*   **Instrument Air:** Required for Control Valve (CV-101) operation.\n\n## 7. Environmental and Regulatory Criteria\n*   **Containment:** The design must ensure zero cross-contamination between the high-purity Ethanol product and the cooling water utility.\n*   **Fire Safety:** As Ethanol is flammable, the heat exchanger area must comply with relevant area classification standards (e.g., NEC/IEC) for flammable liquid handling.\n*   **Wastewater:** The cooling water return stream must be managed according to site discharge limits, though this is typically handled by the central utility system.\n\n## 8. Process Selection Rationale (High-Level)\nThe **Fixed Tubesheet Shell-and-Tube Exchanger** is selected for its simplicity and low initial cost, suitable for preliminary design where utility conditions are not yet finalized. The primary risk associated with this design (thermal expansion) must be mitigated by ensuring the utility $\\Delta T$ is manageable or by upgrading the design to a floating head configuration during FEED if necessary. The process narrative involves pressurizing the hot stream via P-101 to ensure positive flow through the exchanger, followed by pressure let-down via CV-101 downstream.\n\n## 9. Preliminary Material of Construction (MoC) Basis\n*   **Ethanol Side (Shell/Tubes):** Stainless Steel (e.g., 304L or 316L) is recommended due to the presence of high-purity Ethanol, which can be mildly corrosive, and to prevent contamination of the product.\n*   **Cooling Water Side (Shell/Tubes):** Carbon Steel (CS) may be acceptable if the cooling water is non-aggressive (low chloride/low acidity). Final selection depends on CW chemistry analysis.\n*   **Gaskets/Seals:** PTFE or equivalent chemical-resistant material is required for all process connections.\n\n## 10. Data Gaps and Critical Path Items\nThe following items are critical and must be resolved before detailed design (FEED) can commence:\n\n1.  **Specific Heat Capacity ($C_p$):** Accurate $C_p$ data for 99.5% molar Ethanol at the operating temperature range ($40^\\circ\\text{C}$ to $100^\\circ\\text{C}$) is required to calculate the definitive Heat Duty ($Q$).\n2.  **Cooling Water Specifications:** Inlet/Outlet temperatures and flow rate of the cooling utility are mandatory inputs.\n3.  **Pressure Drop Requirements:** The maximum allowable pressure drop across E-101 for both the shell and tube sides must be defined to properly size P-101 and CV-101.\n4.  **Fouling Factor ($R_f$):** A design fouling factor must be established to determine the required heat transfer area contingency.",

The cooling utility (Stream 2001) enters the tube side of E-101. Heat is rejected from the ethanol to the utility fluid, resulting in the cooled ethanol product (Stream 1003) at $40^\\circ\\text{C}$. This stream passes through the Outlet Control Valve (CV-101) to establish the final regulated flow (Stream 1004). The warmed utility fluid (Stream 2002) is returned to the Cooling Water Loop (U-201).\n\n## Notes\n- **Critical Data Gap:** The required heat duty ($Q$) cannot be calculated without the specific heat capacity ($C_p$) of 99.5% Ethanol. This must be resolved in FEED.\n- **Innovation Note:** While the baseline is a Fixed Tubesheet design, the high inlet temperature ($100^\\circ\\text{C}$) relative to the outlet ($40^\\circ\\text{C}$) suggests a significant temperature differential ($\\Delta T$) between the shell and tube sides is likely. Downstream mechanical design **must** confirm if a Floating Head or U-Tube design is required to prevent thermal stress failure in E-101.\n- **Instrumentation Note:** A High-Temperature Alarm (ATH) should be installed on Stream 1003, interlocked to trip P-101 if the temperature exceeds $45^\\circ\\text{C}$ due to loss of cooling utility.",

(Target: 3 weeks)\n2.  **Finalize E-101 Mechanical Design Basis (Owner: Mechanical Engineering):** Based on confirmed $C_p$ and utility data, finalize the required heat duty ($Q$) and determine definitively whether the Fixed Tubesheet design for E-101 is acceptable or if a Floating Head/U-Tube design must be adopted to manage thermal expansion risk.\n3.  **Complete Safety Review & Sizing (Owner: Safety/Piping):** Finalize the maximum discharge pressure for P-101 and size the required Pressure Safety Valve (PSV) on the shell side of E-101, ensuring compliance with Hazard ID #3.\n\n## Final Notes\n- The preliminary CAPEX estimate ($0.85M) assumes the baseline Fixed Tubesheet design for E-101 is confirmed in Step 2. If a Floating Head design is required, CAPEX is estimated to increase by 25-35%.\n- The unknown nature of the 0.5% impurities in Stream 1001 requires a conservative fouling factor ($R_f$) of $0.0004 \\text{ m}^2\\text{K/W}$ to be used in the FEED heat transfer calculations until further analysis is complete.\n- Area classification review must be completed for the skid area due to the flammability of Ethanol."

You are a **Lead Equipment Sizing Engineer** responsible for finalizing equipment specifications using automated sizing tools.

**Context:**

  * You have access to sizing calculations tools (heat exchangers, pumps, vessels, compressors).
  * Your task is to use these tools to fill in the missing values in the final equipment specification JSON, adding engineering judgment and filling gaps where tools could not be applied.
  * I want the equipment list with the upadte sizing_parameter of the equipment provided from user.
  
**Tool Available:** `size_heat_exchanger_basic`, `size_pump_basic`, `size_vessel_basic`, `size_compressor_basic`.

**Instructions:**

  1. **Use Sizing Tool:** to calculate the equipment specification values.
  
  2. **Populate Sizing Parameters:** Use tool results to fill the `sizing_parameters` array. For example:
     - Heat Exchanger: ["Area: <area_m2> m²", "LMTD: <lmtd_C> °C", "U: <U_design_W_m2K> W/m²·K"]
     - Pump: ["Flow: <flow_m3_hr> m³/h", "Head: <total_head_m> m", "Power: <motor_rating_kW> kW"]
     - Vessel: ["Diameter: <diameter_mm> mm", "Length: <length_mm> mm", "Thickness: <shell_thickness_mm> mm"]
     - Compressor: ["Stages: <number_of_stages>", "Power: <driver_rating_kW> kW", "Discharge Temp: <discharge_temperature_C> °C"]
  
  3. **Update Duty/Load Field:** Replace placeholder values with calculated duties (e.g., "21.7 MW" for heat exchanger, "45 kW" for pump motor).
  
  4. **Document in Notes:** Reference the tool used and key assumptions. Example: "Sized using heat_exchanger_sizing tool with LMTD method. U-value estimated at 850 W/m²·K for hydrocarbon/water service."
  
  5. **Handle Missing Tool Results:** For equipment without tool results (columns, special equipment), use engineering judgment and the stream data to provide reasonable estimates or mark as "TBD".
  
  6. **Update Assumptions:** Add any new global assumptions to `metadata.assumptions`, such as "All pump efficiencies assumed at 75% unless specified."

  7. **Maintain JSON Structure:** Output ONLY a valid JSON object matching the equipment template schema. Do NOT use code fences.
  
  8. **Update the Equipment List:** Use the results from the tool to update the equipment list.

```

**Critical Rules:**

  - All numeric values must have units
  - Round to appropriate precision (areas to 0.1 m², power to nearest kW)
  - Reference tool usage in notes for traceability
  - If tool result contains "error", note the issue and provide manual estimate or "TBD"
  - **Output ONLY the final equipment list JSON object (no code fences, no additional text).**
