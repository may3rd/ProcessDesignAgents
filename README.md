# ProcessDesignAgents

ProcessDesignAgents is a multi-agent workflow for conceptual chemical-process design. Each agent is responsible for a portion of the engineering study—from requirement extraction through stream definition, equipment sizing, safety review, and gate approval. The project is inspired by the multi-agent patterns popularised by the [TradingAgents](https://github.com/TauricResearch/TradingAgents) project and adapts those ideas to process engineering.

## Key Features

-   **Graph Orchestrated Agents** – A `langgraph` state machine coordinates requirement analysis, concept detailing, stream definition, simulation, equipment sizing, safety review, and project management.
-   **Structured Artefacts** – Intermediate outputs (requirements, component lists, stream data, equipment details, H&MB summaries) are captured as Markdown and JSON for quick review and downstream automation.
-   **Tool-Assisted Sizing** – Built‑in sizing tools currently cover preliminary heat-exchanger and pump calculations and can be extended with additional tooling.
-   **Markdown & Word Exports** – Aggregated reports can be saved to Markdown or DOCX using a Pandoc-powered export with a customizable template.
-   **CLI Visualisation** – The CLI (`cli/main.py`) streams agent status, tool calls, and report sections as they are produced.

Additional documentation is available under `docs/`. Contributor-specific practices are captured in `AGENTS.md`. Sample end-to-end outputs live in `examples/`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.10+
-   Recommended: virtual environment (e.g. `python -m venv venv`)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/may3rd/ProcessDesignAgents.git
cd ProcessDesignAgents
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set any required API keys for your LLM provider (e.g. `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`) in your environment or `.env`.

## Running the Workflow

### CLI Visualization

```bash
python -m cli.main
```

The CLI streams agent progress, tool invocations, and compiled reports using Rich panels.

### Report Exports

`ProcessDesignGraph.propagate(...)` accepts `save_markdown` and `save_word_doc` arguments. The DOCX path uses Pandoc (via `pypandoc`) together with `python-docx` and a reference template located at `reports/template.docx`. Update that template to change fonts or company styling. Ensure that:

-   Pandoc is installed and available on your `PATH`.
-   `pypandoc` and `python-docx` are installed in your environment.
-   `config["save_dir"]` points to the directory that contains the template.

Both Markdown and Word outputs are created automatically when the associated arguments are provided.

## Examples

Browse `examples/reports/` for sample end-to-end design packages generated by the agents. Each Markdown file mirrors the structure of the aggregated final report, making it a quick way to understand expected outputs before running your own briefs.

## Agent Pipeline (Default Graph)

1. **Process Requirements Analyst** – Extracts structured requirements from the problem statement.
2. **Innovative Researcher** – Brainstorms potential process concepts.
3. **Conservative Researcher** – Refines and validates potential process concepts.
4. **Concept Detailer** – Selects the most feasible concept and builds a detailed brief.
5. **Component List Researcher** – Produces a consolidated component inventory for downstream use.
6. **Design Basis Analyst** – Writes the design basis referencing the concept detail and component list.
7. **Basic PFD Designer** – Produces the conceptual flowsheet narrative in Markdown.
8. **Equipments & Streams List Builder** – Creates the combined equipment/stream scaffold with placeholders.
9. **Stream Data Estimator** – Populates stream properties in the combined artefact.
10. **Equipment Sizing Agent** – Calls sizing tools, updates the combined artefact, and fills equipment details & notes.
11. **Safety & Risk Analyst** – Performs a HAZOP-style review.
12. **Project Manager** – Compiles the final approval report.

The graph wiring lives in `processdesignagents/graph/setup.py`. State fields are defined in `processdesignagents/agents/utils/agent_states.py`.

## Tooling & Extensions

The sizing tools live under `processdesignagents/agents/utils/` and are registered in `ProcessDesignGraph._create_tool_nodes()`. Out of the box the graph exposes `size_heat_exchanger_basic` and `size_pump_basic`; add new preliminary tools (e.g., compressor sizing) by importing them alongside these functions and extending the tool node mapping.

## Development

-   **Tests**: Add unit tests under `tests/` (not yet provided) and run with `pytest`.
-   **Formatting**: Follow `black`/`isort` style conventions if you add CI.
-   **Docs**: Update `docs/` when the graph or agent prompts change.
